<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>This volume has been principally compiled from
the tenth English edition of the Memoirs of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Martyn</span>, by the <span class="smcap">Rev. John Sargent</span>.</p>

<p>The author of the present publication has endeavoured
to present his subject in a manner which
may not mislead the young, in forming their estimate
of Christian character, and to propose the
humble missionary, as an imitable example, rather
than an object of vague and curious admiration.
To effect this design, he has avoided, as much as
possible, the use of terms of personal eulogy; in
hopes that the perusal of the biography will leave
upon the youthful reader a deeper impression of
the indispensable need of Divine power, to enable
any creature to lead a useful and holy life. Children
are taught, at least by implication, to believe,
that the eminent instances of piety and zeal, which
are recorded both in sacred and ordinary history,
are exceptions to the doctrine of Christ, who
directed his disciples to say—even after they should
have done “<em>all</em> those things which were commanded—we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
are unprofitable servants; we have
done that which was our duty to do.” This
course is likely not only to create an illusion which
more mature knowledge will but imperfectly dissipate,
but to diminish the splendor of the single
example of perfect righteousness which has blessed
our world. Its tendency, moreover, is to foster
that hidden corruption of religious vanity in the
heart of the young Christian, which usually needs
no extraneous aid to assist it in impeding the
growth of grace.</p>

<p>It would seem, that the Memoirs of a Christian
should be rather adapted to instruct the living, than
to applaud the dead; and it is surprising that so
few works of the kind are extant, prepared with
evangelical discrimination. It is especially important
that this principle should be regarded in
biographies designed for pupils in Sunday schools
and it would be a new honor to the institution, if
the productions in this department, which claim
their patronage, should be marked by this rare
moral distinction.</p>

HENRY MARTYN.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>The father of Henry Martyn was a workman in
the tin mines of Cornwall, in England. As the
miners worked very deep in the earth, shut
out from the light of the sun, and breathing an
unwholesome air, it was their custom to labour
four hours, and then to spend the same length of
time in resting. During these hours of rest, John
Martyn devoted himself to improving his education,
which had been very slight; and by his industrious
application, he soon became so well acquainted
with arithmetic, that he was at length engaged, as
clerk, by a merchant in the town of Truro, in the
county of Cornwall. The conduct of this man is
an example to all persons whose occupations afford
them any leisure. There is scarcely any one who
is so constantly occupied, as not to have some time
in the week, for the improvement of his mind.
Had John Martyn made no exertion to supply his
want of early instruction, he would probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
have wasted his life in the miserable toil of
digging ore, in the unwholesome depths of the
mines. But by employing his spare time in learning,
instead of wasting it in idleness and intemperance,
he was soon enabled to maintain his family
respectably, and to save his children from the evils
of ignorance, by giving them a good education.</p>

<p>Henry, his third child, the subject of this
volume, was born at Truro, on the 18th of February,
1781, and before he was eight years old,
was put under the charge of an excellent schoolmaster.
At school he was remarkable for the gentleness
of his disposition; yet he was not a general
favourite with his school-fellows, as, owing to the
mildness of his spirit, he was not inclined to engage
in their sports, and was fond of quiet. After spending
seven years at this school, his father sent him
to the city of Oxford, hoping that he would be
admitted as a student in one of the colleges of the
celebrated university at that place, and be supported
by funds which are raised for that purpose, called
scholarships. From the boys who apply for admission
on these terms, the most promising scholars
are selected; but Henry had not been very studious,
and, though some of his examiners were in favour of
electing him, he did not succeed. He afterwards
considered this failure as a great mercy; for had he
been thrown, when not fifteen years of age, into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
evil company which he would then have met with
at college, he might have become dissolute beyond
recovery. He returned to his school, and remained
under the same teacher, until he entered St. John’s
college, in the university of Cambridge, in October,
1797.</p>

<p>Ambitious to be distinguished, and anxious to
gratify his father, he applied himself diligently
to study during his stay in college. He was
moral and amiable in his conduct, excepting that
his temper, which was usually very mild, was
sometimes irritated to an improper degree, and
led him, as unrestrained passions always lead
those who indulge them, to hasty and dangerous
conduct. Excellent as his outward character was,
it was not so because he was anxious to fulfil his
duty to God, who requires purity of heart and life
from all his intelligent creatures. And he was so
insensible, at this time, to the fact, that God most
justly claims that every being should live to his
glory, that he thought it a very strange doctrine,
when a pious friend told him that he ought to attend
to his studies, not for the sake of gaining praise
from man, but that he might be the better qualified to
promote the glory of God. He could not, however,
but acknowledge that it was entirely reasonable,
and determined that he would hold and maintain
this opinion, but never once meant that it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
govern his conduct. Of course, his holding a correct
opinion, without acting accordingly, was worth
nothing, and only increased his sinfulness; as he
continued to follow his own ambition, after he was
convinced that God rightfully claimed all his services.
Thus, many persons are well acquainted
with the history, doctrines, and commands of the
holy scriptures, who do not live according to what
they require, and aggravate their guilt, because
they sin wilfully, after knowing the truth. And
thus many believe all that is in the scriptures,
as they believe what is written in other books; but
that belief or faith, only, is of any value to a man,
which causes him to receive the truth in his heart,
as well as in his memory; to live according to its
requirements, and to obey the commandment, “repent
and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ;” which
is just as binding on the whole human family, as any
of the ten commandments which were given at
Sinai.</p>

<p>The great desire of Martyn’s heart was to excel
at college, and to be foremost in his class, and this
ambition occupied his mind so entirely, that he
lived without God, and as if the world had been
created for his honor, instead of the Maker’s. His
wishes and aims were all selfish; he envied and
even hated those who, by greater industry or talents,
attained to more distinction than he could reach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
whilst, in his pride, he considered himself superior
to all, and professed to regard them with contempt.
These unholy feelings were so much increased by
his disappointment in not gaining as high honours
as he aspired to, that upon a visit to his home
during a vacation, he used disrespectful language to
his father, when he would express opinions differing
from his own. When he became a penitent,
and looked back to this period, he exclaimed, “Oh
what an example of patience and mildness was he! I
love to think of his excellent qualities, and it is frequently
the anguish of my heart, that I ever could be
so base and wicked, as to pain him by the slightest
neglect. Oh my God and Father, why is not my
heart doubly agonized at the remembrance of all
my transgressions against Thee, ever since I have
known Thee as such!”—During this same visit,
which was the last time he saw his father, his pious
sister often spoke to him on the subject of religion;
but he confessed, that the sound of the gospel,
thus tenderly accompanied with the admonitions
of a sister, was grating to his ears. Yet he could
not escape the conviction that she spoke the truth,
when she urged its claims upon him; but then it
required him to sacrifice his selfish ambition, and
this was too dear an object to give up. He promised
to read the Bible, but when he reached college,
his studies filled all his thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact, which he afterwards
acknowledged, that during his stay at home the
wickedness of his heart rose to a greater height than
at any other time, yet the change which soon afterwards
took place in him, seems to have been connected
with the peculiar state of his circumstances
and feelings at that period. At an examination
after his return to college, his ambition attained its
object, and he was pronounced first in his class.
A few weeks afterwards, he received information
of the sudden death of his father. This was a great
affliction to him, and was more severe, as it happened
in the midst of his triumph, and brought to
his remembrance the acts of filial disrespect which
his evil passions had led him so lately to commit.
Finding that in this state of mind, he could take no
pleasure in his usual studies, he resorted to his
Bible, under the impression that its perusal would
be more suitable to his present feelings. In this
new direction of his inquiries he was encouraged
by his pious friend at college, and commenced
reading Luke’s narrative of the Acts of the Apostles,
as the most entertaining part of the New Testament.
This led him gradually to examine the
doctrines of those holy men; and the duty of
religion, in the circumstances of his affliction, made
this much of an impression, that he began to use
prayers, and to ask formally for pardon, though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
had little sense of his sinfulness. His heart was
evidently softened by the occurrence of his father’s
death; and the admonitions and prayers of his sister,
with the convictions of his own judgment, disposed
him to pay attention to the subject, from which
he was not violently drawn away, as formerly, by
his pursuit of fame, having now reached the highest
station to which he could attain in his class.
But his pride caused him to shrink from the humility
which every sinner must feel before he can
come to the Saviour: so little did he yet know his
own heart; for the man who truly feels the condition
in which he stands in the sight of a Supreme
Being, infinitely great, infinitely holy, infinitely
just, against whose laws, and mercy, and goodness,
he has sinned without excuse, cannot but be humble
when he becomes acquainted with his true
character.</p>

<p>Such was the apparent commencement of the
influence of the Holy Spirit on Martyn’s heart; and
although on his return to Cambridge, those sacred
impressions were in danger of being destroyed by
his diligent application to the study of mathematics,
which once more threatened to engage his whole
attention, yet the divine mercy preserved him in
the trial. Some passages in a letter written to
his sister at this period, show that religion
must have entered into his daily thoughts, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he was already brought to see the reasonableness
and beauty of spiritual devotion.</p>

<p>“What a blessing it is for me, that I have such
a sister as you, my dear S—, who have been so
instrumental in keeping me in the right way. When
I consider how little human assistance you have
had, and the great knowledge to which you have
attained on the subject of religion, especially observing
the extreme ignorance of the most wise and
learned of this world, I think this is itself a proof
of the wonderful influence of the Holy Ghost on
the minds of well-disposed persons. It is certainly
by the Spirit alone that we can have the will, or
power, or knowledge, or confidence to pray; and
by Him alone we come unto the Father through
Jesus Christ. ‘Through Him we both have access
by one Spirit unto the Father.’ How I rejoice to
find that we disagreed only about words! I did
not doubt, as you suppose, at all about that joy
which true believers feel. Can there be any one
subject, any one source of cheerfulness and joy, at
all to be compared with the heavenly serenity and
comfort which such a person must find in holding
communion with his God and Saviour in prayer;
in addressing God as his Father, and more than all,
in the transporting hope of being preserved unto
everlasting life, and of singing praises to his Redeemer
when time shall be no more? Oh! I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
indeed feel this state of mind at times; but at
other times I feel quite humbled at finding myself
so cold and hard-hearted. That reluctance to
prayer, that unwillingness to come unto God, who
is the fountain of all good, when reason and experience
tell us, that with him only true pleasure is to
be found, seem to be owing to Satanic influence.”</p>

<p>After mentioning that his mathematical studies
required such deep thought as to exclude, for the
time, every other subject from the mind, and that
they were, on this account, very dangerous to him,
he speaks in the same letter of the beginning of his
religious feelings.</p>

<p>“After the death of our father, you know I was
extremely low-spirited; and, like most other people,
began to consider seriously, without any particular
determination, that invisible world to which
he was gone, and to which I must one day go.
Yet I still read the Bible unenlightened; and said
a prayer or two rather through terror of a superior
power than from any other cause. Soon, however,
I began to attend more diligently to the words of
our Saviour in the New Testament, and to devour
them with delight; when the offers of mercy and
forgiveness were made so freely, I supplicated to
be made partaker of the covenant of grace with
eagerness and hope: and thanks be to the ever-blessed
Trinity for not leaving me without comfort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Throughout the whole, however, even when the
light of divine truth was beginning to dawn on my
mind, I was not under that great terror of future
punishment, which I now see plainly I had every
reason to feel: I look back now upon that course
of wickedness which, like a gulf of destruction,
yawned to swallow me up, with a trembling delight,
mixed with shame at having lived so long in ignorance,
and error, and blindness. I could say much
more, but I have no more room. I have only to
express my acquiescence in <em>most</em> of your opinions,
and to join with you in gratitude to God for his
mercies to us: may he preserve you and me and
all of us to the day of the Lord!”</p>
<br>

<hr class="r5">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>Still the desire of applause, and the ambition
of distinction as a scholar, that great temptation of
ardent youth, kept him from making much progress
in the infinitely more important study of divine
truth. His heart was still destitute of humility,
and he was not yet sensible of the real vanity
of human pursuits. This lesson, however, the
providence of God taught him in the manner which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of all others, would make the deepest impression
on such a mind as his. It was not until he received
the highest honours of college, in January 1801,
that he felt that temporal gratifications cannot satisfy
the desires of the soul. “I obtained my highest
wishes,” he said, “but was surprised to find that I
grasped a shadow.” He felt a disappointment
which astonished himself, that the great object for
which he had laboured so hard, and sacrificed so
much, and which had caused him even to neglect the
interest which he had in eternity, should now seem
as vain and unsatisfying, as if he had been toiling
to pursue a shadow! Happy is the youth who will
not wait for experience to convince him that this is
a truth, and will believe what the word of God
asserts to be the end of all such hopes and efforts;
who will trust the declarations of those men who
have tried for themselves, and, like Martyn, have
been obliged, in the midst of their triumph, honestly
to confess that they were disappointed of the happiness
which they calculated on as sure. Martyn
had been so diligent in order to gain this supposed
reward, that his fellow-students called him ‘the man
who had not lost an hour;’ he found too late that
he had for ever lost many hours of opportunity
of acquiring the knowledge of divine truth, and
of his own duty, and many hours of happiness,
such as all the honours, and even all the pleasures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of learning, can never confer, or compensate a man
for its loss.</p>

<p>Martyn spent the vacation of the next summer
at college, and had the opportunity of being much
alone; and his attention not being absorbed by his
studies as formerly, he was able to give a more serious
and deep attention to the condition of his soul.
He devoted much time to meditation upon his past
life, the wandering of his affection from God, and
the necessity of some great change in his heart, to
bring him to make that willing devotion of himself
to his service, which he saw was reasonably required
of him, and which he felt ought to be his highest
happiness.</p>

<p>“God,” he observes, “was pleased to bless the
solitude and retirement I enjoyed this summer, to
my improvement: and not until then had I ever
experienced any real pleasure in religion. I was
more convinced of sin than ever, more earnest in
fleeing to Jesus for refuge, and more desirous of
the renewal of my nature.”</p>

<p>His friendship with the Rev. Mr. Simeon, of
Cambridge, and several pious young men, was a
great advantage in winning his affections to religion,
and giving him a correct view of the Christian character.
He had determined to apply himself to the
study of law, chiefly, as he confessed, “because he
could not consent to be poor for Christ’s sake,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
but he now felt willing to cut off all prospect of
temporal distinction, and resolved to prepare for the
ministry. The influence of the Spirit seemed to attend
the use of the means of spiritual knowledge,
so that he could write to a friend in September
1801, “blessed be God, I have now experienced
that Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom
of God. What a blessing is the gospel! No
heart can conceive its excellency, but that which
has been renewed by divine grace.” About the
same time he wrote thus to his sister:</p>

<p>“When we consider the misery and darkness of
the unregenerate world, oh! with how much reason
should we burst out into thanksgiving to God,
who has called us in his mercy through Christ
Jesus! Who that reflects upon the rock from
which he was hewn, but must rejoice to give himself
entirely and without reserve to God, to be
sanctified by his Spirit. The soul that has truly
experienced the love of God, will not stay meanly
inquiring how much he shall do, and thus limit his
service; but will be earnestly seeking, more and
more, to know the will of our heavenly Father, that
he may be enabled to do it. O may we be both
thus minded! may we experience Christ to be our
all in all, not only as our Redeemer, but as the
fountain of grace. Those passages of the word of
God which you have quoted on this head, are indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
awakening; may they teach us to breathe
after holiness, to be more and more dead to the
world, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ:
We are lights in the world; how needful then
that our tempers and lives should manifest our
high and heavenly calling. Let us, as we do,
provoke one another to good works, not doubting
but that God will bless our feeble endeavours to
his glory.”</p>

<p>Happening to call at a house where a gentleman,
with whom he had a slight acquaintance, was lying
ill, he found his wife in great agony, on account of
the unprepared state of her husband to enter eternity,
and in expectation of being left with her family
entirely destitute of maintenance, if he should die.
He found it in vain to direct her thoughts to God,
whom they both had probably neglected to serve in
their prosperity, and he went to visit her daughters,
who had removed to another house, that their appearance
of grief might not disturb the dying man.
Upon entering the room, he found a member of
college diverting their thoughts by reading a play to
them. He was so astonished and indignant at the
sight, that he rebuked the young man in such a
manner that he thought it would produce a quarrel
between them. But he was joyfully surprised afterwards,
when he came to thank him for the reproof,
and acknowledge that it had made a serious impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
on his mind, which proved to be permanent;
and Mr. Martyn was afterwards associated
with him as a missionary in India.</p>

<p>In March 1802, Mr. Martyn was successful in
being elected to a fellowship in the college—a
privilege granted to a select number of the best
scholars, who are, on certain conditions, supported
by the funds of the college, and have the privilege
of residing there. Soon afterwards he obtained
the first prize, for having produced the best
Latin composition. Thus he was rising rapidly
to distinction, and his prospects of success in life
were brilliant. His talents and acquirements would
no doubt have easily procured him honourable and
profitable employment. His strong natural passion
of ambition had every thing that is tempting in
success, to allure him in its path: the prospect of
a distinguished career was opening most favourably
before him. The sincerity of his resolution to seek
first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
was put to the strongest trial; yet, through the Divine
grace, he was enabled to overlook all these
temporal advantages, and made willing to consecrate
his powers to the promotion of the glory of
God. He had resolved to enter the ministry: but
even in that profession, in England, there is a large
field open for ambition, and the learning and talents
of Martyn might have gained him some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
highest stations in the church, where wealth, ease,
and eminence could be enjoyed. But his great desire
was to be employed in the manner in which
he could do the most good to his fellow men, and
promote the glory of God, by extending the knowledge
of Jesus Christ and his gospel. He knew, too,
that in the humblest station he would be most likely
to increase in spiritual piety, as he would be exposed
to fewer of those temptations, by which he
had already been so much endangered. He therefore
determined to become a foreign missionary,
and offered himself as such to the English society,
now called “The Church Missionary Society for
Africa and the East.”</p>

<p>It is too often the case, that in perusing the life
of an eminent disciple of Christ, the reader is led
to suppose that the person who is spoken of in
such terms of praise by the author, was so excellent
that he went beyond the holiness and duty that are
required of men generally, and that his devotedness
must be a ground of worth in the sight of God.
This manner of writing should be carefully avoided,
as it encourages human presumption, by leading
men to trust much in the amount of good that they
may do, and flatters their pride by persuading them
that great sacrifices in the cause of Christianity <em>entitle</em>
them to distinction, not only in this world, but
in the eye of heaven. Alas! it is because so few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
persons make any self-denial, to promote the honour
of the Redeemer, that such consequences result.
If every Christian were to give up all his property,
and leave home and family for ever, and go to dwell
amongst the most degraded nations of the furthest
lands, it would not reach the amount of obligation
they are under; it would not equal, by ten thousand
degrees, the favours of Jesus Christ to this
world. Man can never, by all his good deeds,
have a <em>claim</em> to the rewards of heaven. Even
after a long life thus spent in wretchedness and
banishment, for the sake of doing good and converting
souls, it is an act of God’s mere mercy, and
that for Christ’s sake, that any one is accepted as a
faithful servant, and in this sense, counted worthy
of the kingdom of heaven. But the usefulness of
such writings consists in showing how much good
an individual, under the blessing of God, may perform;
and thus encouraging other men to undertake
great plans of usefulness, by the proof that He condescends
to make use of human creatures in accomplishing
his great purposes of mercy to the world.
An instance of such devotedness to the service of
God, is often more powerful in inducing others to
follow the example, than even the fact which is so
clear from scripture, that God effects his purposes
by human agency, and that it is therefore men’s
duty to do their utmost, at all hazards, to promote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the divine designs. So it was in the case of Martyn
himself, whose thoughts were led to a missionary
life, by the accounts of the great success which had
attended the labours of Dr. Carey in India, and of
David Brainerd among the American Indians. And
the object of preparing this life of Henry Martyn, is
not to praise him, for he only did his duty; and even
this, as he acknowledged, he did not do, (as no
Christian in this life does,) with that entire devotedness
to Christ, and freedom from all sinful and selfish
motives which the service of our Divine master
requires. But our great design is to encourage our
young readers to aim at doing much for Christ; and
to show the power of Divine grace which overcame
the worldly ambition, and love of wealth and comfort,
which were natural to Martyn, and induced
him to leave all prospect of happiness from these
sources, and to give himself up wholly to the employment
of carrying the knowledge of the way
of salvation to nations who were in all the darkness
of idolatry.</p>

<p>Nor are we to suppose that it cost Martyn no
struggle, to give up all these prospects. Men are
seldom so much sanctified, as to make great sacrifices
with entire cheerfulness. He had still to strive
with his pride, his love of the world, his indisposition
to toil amongst a wretched and ignorant people;
but he found strength to sustain these trials by persevering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
earnest prayer; by meditating more on
the duty he owed his Maker, and the return which
the atonement that Christ had made for his sins,
called for from him. Thus, through God’s favour,
not through any ability of his own, he became
the useful man he afterwards was in India.</p>

<p>The nature of the temptations he underwent at
times, may be understood from his own candid
statement of them to his pious sister.</p>

<p>“I received your letter yesterday, and thank God
for the concern you manifest for my spiritual welfare.
O that we may love each other more and
more in the Lord. The passages you bring from
the word of God, were appropriate to my case,
particularly those from the first Epistle of St. Peter,
and that to the Ephesians; though I do not seem
to have given you a right view of my state. The
dejection I sometimes labour under seems not to
arise from doubts of my acceptance with God,
though it tends to produce them; nor from desponding
views of my own backwardness in the divine
life, for I am more prone to self-dependence and
conceit; but from the prospect of the <em>difficulties I
have to encounter in the whole of my future life</em>.
The thought that I must be unceasingly employed
in the same kind of work, amongst poor ignorant
people, is what my proud spirit revolts at. To be
obliged to submit to a thousand uncomfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
things that must happen to me, whether as a minister
or a missionary, is what the flesh cannot endure.
At these times I feel neither love to God, nor love
to man; and in proportion as these graces of the
Spirit languish, my besetting sins, pride, and discontent,
and unwillingness for every duty, make
me miserable.</p>

<p>“You will best enter into my views by considering
those texts which serve to recall me to a right aspect
of things. I have not that coldness in prayer you
would expect, but generally find myself strengthened
in faith and humility and love after it: but
the impression is so short. I am at this time
enabled to give myself, body, soul, and spirit, to
God, and perceive it to be my most reasonable
service. How it may be when the trial comes, I
know not, yet I will trust and not be afraid. In
order to <em>do</em> his will cheerfully, I want love for the
souls of men; to <em>suffer</em> it, I want humility: let
these be the subjects of your supplications for me.
I am thankful to God that you are so free from
anxiety and care: we cannot but with praise
acknowledge his goodness. What does it signify
whether we be rich or poor, if we are sons of God?
How unconscious are they of their real greatness,
and will be so till they find themselves in glory!
When we contemplate our everlasting inheritance,
it seems too good to be true; yet it is no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
than is due to the kindred of ‘God manifest in
the flesh.’</p>

<p>“A journey I took last week into Norfolk seems
to have contributed greatly to my health. The
attention and admiration shown me are great and
very dangerous. The praises of men do not now,
indeed, flatter my vanity as they formerly did; I
rather feel pain, through anticipation of their
consequences: but they tend to produce, imperceptibly,
a self-esteem and hardness of heart. How
awful and awakening a consideration is it, that God
judgeth not as man judgeth! Our character before
him, is precisely as it was before or after any
change of external circumstances. Men may applaud
or revile, and make a man think differently
of himself; but <em>He</em> judgeth of a man according to
his secret walk. How difficult is the work of self-examination!
Even to state to you, imperfectly,
my own mind, I found to be no easy matter. Nay,
St. Paul says, ‘I judge not mine own self, for he
that judgeth me is the Lord.’ That is, though he
was not conscious of any allowed sin, yet he was
not thereby justified, for God might perceive something
of which he was not aware. How needful
then, the prayer of the Psalmist, ‘Search me, O
God, and try my heart, and see if there be any
evil way in me.’ May God be with you, and
bless you, and uphold you with the right hand of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
his righteousness: and let us seek to love; for ‘he
that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, for God is
love.’”</p>

<p>His diary furnishes a farther insight into his
experience, and the resoluteness with which he
opposed the wavering of his faith by continual
application to the promises of God in Christ.</p>

<p>“Since I have endeavoured to divest myself of
every consideration independent of religion, I see
the difficulty of maintaining a liveliness in devotion
for any considerable time together; nevertheless,
as I shall have to pass the greater part of my future
life, after leaving England, with no other source of
happiness than reading, meditation, and prayer, I
think it right to be gradually mortifying myself to
every species of worldly pleasure.”—“In all my
past life I have fixed on some desirable ends, at
different distances, the attainment of which was to
furnish me with happiness. But now, in seasons
of unbelief, nothing seems to lie before me but one
vast uninteresting wilderness, and heaven appearing
but dimly at the end. Oh! how does this show
the necessity of living by faith! What a shame
that I cannot make the doing of God’s will my ever
delightful object, and the prize of my high calling
the mark after which I press!”</p>

<p>“I was under disquiet at the prospect of my
future work, encompassed, as it appeared, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
difficulties; but I trusted I was under the guidance
of infinite wisdom, and on that I could rest. Mr.
Johnson, who had returned from a mission, observed
that the crosses to be endured were far greater
than could be conceived; but ‘none of these things
move me, neither count I my life dear unto me,
so that I might finish my course with joy.’—Had
some disheartening thoughts at night, at the prospect
of being stripped of every earthly comfort;
but who is it that maketh my comforts to be a
source of enjoyment? Cannot the same hand
make cold, and hunger, and nakedness, and peril,
to be a train of ministering angels conducting me
to glory?”—“O my soul, compare thyself with St.
Paul, and with the example and precepts of the
Lord Jesus Christ. Was it not his meat and drink
to do the will of his heavenly Father?”</p>

<p>“What is the state of my own soul before God?
I believe that it is right in principle: I desire no
other portion but God: but I pass so many hours
as if there were no God at all. I live far below
the hope, comfort, and holiness of the Gospel:
but be not slothful, O my soul;—look unto Jesus
the author and finisher of thy faith. For whom
was grace intended, if not for me? Are not the
promises made to me? Is not my Maker in earnest,
when he declareth that he willeth my sanctification,
and hath laid help on one that is mighty?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
I will therefore have no confidence in the flesh,
but will rejoice in the Lord, and the joy of the
Lord shall be my strength. May I receive from
above a pure, a humble, a benevolent, a heavenly
mind!”</p>

<p>“Learnt by heart some of the first three chapters
of Revelations. This is to me the most searching
and alarming part of the Bible; yet now with
humble hope I trusted, that the censures of my
Lord did not belong to me: except that those
words, Rev. ii. 3. ‘For my name’s sake thou
hast laboured and hast not fainted,’ were far too
high a testimony for me to think of appropriating
to myself; nevertheless I besought the Lord, that
whatever I had been, I might now be perfect and
complete in all the will of God.”—“Men frequently
admire me, and I am pleased; but I abhor the
pleasure I feel; oh! did they but know that my
root is rottenness!”—“Heard Professor Farish
preach at Trinity Church, on Luke xii. 4, 5, and
was deeply impressed with the reasonableness and
necessity of the fear of God. Felt it to be a light
matter to be judged of man’s judgment; why have
I not awful apprehensions of the glorious Being at
all times? The particular promise—‘him that
overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of
my God, and he shall go no more out,’ dwelt a
long time in my mind, and diffused an affectionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
reverence of God.”—“I see a great work before
me now, namely, the subduing and mortifying
of my perverted will. What am I that I should
<em>dare</em> to do my own will, even if I were not a sinner;
but now how plain, how reasonable to have the
love of Christ constraining me to be his faithful
willing servant, cheerfully taking up the cross he
shall appoint me.”—“Read some of Amos. The
reading of the Prophets is to me one of the most
delightful employments. One cannot but be charmed
with the beauty of the imagery, while they
never fail to inspire me with awful thoughts of God
and of his hatred of sin. The reading of Baxter’s
Saint’s Rest, determined me to live more in heavenly
meditation.”—“Walked by moonlight, and found
it a sweet relief to my mind to think of God and
consider my ways before him. I was strongly
impressed with the vanity of the world, and could
not help wondering at the imperceptible operation
of grace, which had enabled me to resign the expectation
of happiness from it.”—“How frequently
has my heart been refreshed, by the descriptions
in the Scriptures of the future glory of the Church,
and the happiness of man hereafter.”—“I felt
the force of Baxter’s observation, that if an angel
had appointed to meet me, I should be full of
awe; how much more when I am about to meet
God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! what a heart is mine! The indistinctness
of my view of its desperate wickedness is terrible
to me, that is, when I am capable of feeling any
terror. But now my soul! rise from earth and
hell,—shall Satan lead me captive at his will, when
Christ ever liveth to make intercession for the
vilest worm? O thou! whose I am by creation,
preservation, redemption, no longer my own, but,
his who lived and died and rose again, once more
would I resign this body and soul, mean and
worthless as they are, to the blessed disposal of
thy holy will! May I have a heart to love God
and his people, the flesh being crucified! May
grace abound, where sin has abounded much! May
I cheerfully and joyfully resign my ease and life in
the service of Jesus, to whom I owe so much!
May it be sweet to me to proclaim to sinners like
myself, the blessed efficacy of my Saviour’s blood!
May he make me faithful unto death! The greatest
enemy I dread is the pride of my own heart.
Through pride reigning, I should forget to know a
broken spirit: then would come on unbelief, weakness,
apostacy.”</p>

<p>“Let then,” he wrote to a friend, “no obstacle
intervene, to prevent the increase of my self-knowledge,
in which I am lamentably deficient. Let us
both bend our minds to the discipline necessary to
obtain it, and communicate our discoveries for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
mutual benefit. How strongly is the importance
of self-knowledge, and the difficulty of obtaining it,
marked by these words; ‘Keep thy heart with all
diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.’ And
to those who cannot keep their hearts for want of
knowing any thing about them, very compassionate
are the words of our Lord; ‘Because thou knowest
not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
and blind, and naked, I counsel thee to buy of me
gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and
white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou
mayest see.’ You put me in mind, in your last
letter, of former days. What fruit had we then in
those things, whereof we are now ashamed? But
those days have passed away for ever. And when
glory shall open upon our view, neither sorrow
nor sin, shall again interrupt our joys for ever. I
will echo your words, and say, ‘What manner of
love is this, that we should be called the sons of
God!’ We may look upon one another, and remember
our former selves, and say, ‘What hath
God wrought!’ ‘Not by works of righteousness
which thou hast done, but according to his mercy
he saved thee.’ Now then, my dear brother, let
all the rest of our life be cheerfully devoted to God.
We are no longer our own, but are bought with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
price—with what a price! Let us adore him also,
that we are called in our youth; that while our
hearts are susceptible of warm emotions, they are
taught the glow of Divine affections. Let us glorify
him on the earth, if many years are assigned us,
and finish the work which he hath given us to do.
And may we come to our graves in a full age, as a
shock of corn cometh in his season.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn was ordained to the ministry on
the 22d of October, 1803. He complained to a
friend that “this occasion, so solemn in itself,
through want of retirement, was not so to me.”</p>

<p>He passed the time, which, by the rules of the
English Episcopal church, is required before ministers
can be admitted to the full exercise of the
sacred office, as assistant to his friend, the Rev.
Mr. Simeon, in his church at Cambridge, and as
pastor in a small village at a short distance from the
town. In this capacity he laboured constantly in
preaching, and in making religious visits to the
houses of the poor, and to hospitals.</p>

<p>After speaking of his preparations for the pulpit,
he says, “Another part of my stated ministrations,
is to visit one part of Mr. Simeon’s people every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
week. Unless the mind be in a spiritual and heavenly
frame, it is difficult to go through this service
with any degree of satisfaction. However, though
I have often gone to them cramped with sinful fear,
I have been enabled to go through with ease and
comfort, thanks be to God. I have been generally
in great depression of spirits ever since my ordination;
for, having at that time not a single sermon,
my hands and head have been constantly employed
in that business, while my heart has not had its
due share of exercise. I am now recovering from
my cowardly despondency on that head; but lately
I have been in heaviness again, through the prevalence
of self-will, and the prospect of incessant self-denial.
God help me to endure hardness, as a
good soldier of Christ Jesus; to fight the good fight
of faith; and to be a partaker of the afflictions of
the Gospel, according to the power of God. My
chief comfort is to meditate on the world to come,
though it is a happiness which I can seldom steadily
enjoy, the train of one’s thoughts is so influenced
and directed by the empty concerns of human life.
Another evil with me is great childish levity, and
want of serious conviction of the awful work of the
ministry. In the pulpit I have hitherto been thinking
only of the sermon before me, unconscious of
the presence of God or the people. Deliver me
from blood-guiltiness, O God!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>During this interval, the estate which his sister
and himself inherited from their father, was lost;
and instead of being able to go out as a missionary,
at his own expense, as appears to have been his
original design, he now sought an appointment as
a chaplain of the East India Company, to be employed
at some of their stations; which he thought
would give him great advantages in preaching to
the heathen. We copy here another of his letters:</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that the Gospel spreads
among you, for the sake of my poor fellow-sinners.
O that I had the glory of Christ more at heart!
Most of us have far too little earnestness; and I
for one. Wall’s Lane is in my parish here. Its
well known character will give you to understand
that I have abundant room for the exercise of zeal.
I have as yet visited only the two alms-houses and
the poor-house, in which I meet the people once a
week, and two or three other houses. To cleanse
these stables of Augeas, I may well be taught a
useful lesson from the fabled hero—not to attempt
the work in my own strength, but to turn the river
of grace into it. In my country parish, religion is
at a low ebb. The school, however, is re-established;
and the benefit of it will, I trust, be of
eternal consequence. With respect to my own
heart, my dear friend, what shall I say? I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
been visited, of late, with some very severe trials;
of which the loss of the fortunes of myself and two
sisters is the <em>least</em>. As often as the pride and
arrogance of my heart are brought down into the
dust, and I am able to walk softly before the Lord,
I am peaceful and happy enough. My present
desire is to walk <em>alone</em> with God. I have lived too
much in public; going to God in prayer as if I
were coming out of a crowd, and about to be tossed
into it again. But to walk with God is surely to
be with him always; to preach as one delivering
the message in his presence; to plead with souls
as in the stead of the invisible God near us. Ah, my
brother, we die <em>alone</em>. If we have not lived in
solitary communion with God, we shall start at
finding ourselves, in the solemn silence of death,
about to launch forward where no friends, no ordinances,
can accompany us.”</p>

<p>We cannot help observing, how the impressive
thought, contained in the last sentences, was strikingly
and literally exemplified, in the circumstances
of his own decease. He shortly wrote again:</p>

<p>“I am about to alter my plan of preaching to
my country congregation. They have been hearing
from me the Gospel, for which they are by no
means prepared: for I have discovered, to my surprise
and grief, that they do not know the difference
between sin and duty. It is now my design to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
explain to them the Commandments, Sermon on
the Mount, &amp;c.”—“Through the tender mercy of
God, I begin to feel a little more zeal and earnestness
than formerly. O, my brother, how great the
honour that in our <em>office</em> at least, we are like to
Christ; that, in this respect, as he was, so are we
in this world! May love carry forward our feet in
swift obedience; and may we continue in our work,
with all firmness, and patience, and tenderness for
the souls of men!”</p>

<p>Martyn spent much of his time in devotion, and
in reading the scriptures. He committed large portions
to memory, that he might always have a subject
for meditation; and whenever he became so
interested in any other book, as to have reason to
fear that it was more pleasing to him than the
Bible, he would at once lay it aside; until, by returning
to the sacred volume, his mind was restored
to feel the value and interest of its truths above all
others. He was in the habit of setting apart whole
days for secret religious services, examining his
heart, searching the scriptures, and imploring the
mercy and direction of God. And that he might
do this with the least interruption, he was accustomed
to abstain from his usual food at such seasons;
as devout men, from very ancient times, have observed
fasts. He thus speaks in his diary of the
reasons and effect of these occasions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“I felt the need of setting apart a day for the
restoration of my soul by solemn prayer: my views
of eternity are becoming dim and transient. I
could live for ever in prayer, if I could always
speak to God. I sought to pause, and to consider
what I wanted, and to look up with fear and faith,
and I found the benefit; for my soul was soon composed
to that devout sobriety which I knew by its
sweetness to be its proper frame. I was engaged
in prayer in the manner I like, <em>deep seriousness</em>;
at the end of it, I felt great fear of forgetting the
presence of God, and of leaving him as soon as I
should leave the posture of devotion. I was led
through the mists of unbelief, and spake to God as
one that was true; and rejoiced exceedingly that
he was holy and faithful. I endeavoured to consider
myself as being alone on the earth with him,
and that greatly promoted my approach to his presence.
My prayer for a meek and holy sobriety
was granted. O how sweet the dawn of heaven!”</p>

<p>As there was every prospect of succeeding in the
application he had made for an Indian chaplaincy,
he began to prepare for his departure, by taking
leave of his friends in Cornwall. This was, of
course, a severe trial. He was to bid farewell to
country and friends, to sisters, and a lady to whom
he was still more tenderly attached, with the prospect
of never again seeing them in this world. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
a person of his amiable and domestic disposition,
such a separation was full of distress. Besides,
he was going to reside in another, and far distant
continent, in a climate so hot, that it always weakens,
and is often fatal to the constitutions of natives
of cooler countries. The people with whom he expected
to live, were uneducated, poor, vicious, and
idolatrous. Having never been instructed in Christianity,
his task would be to overcome, if possible,
the prejudices in favour of their own superstitions,
which they and their ancestors had cherished for
centuries; and to persuade them to adopt a religion
which would oblige them to give up their dearest sinful
enjoyments. Ignorant of each other’s language,
he would be obliged to study theirs, although one
little known to Europeans, and extremely difficult to
be acquired. These discouragements are mentioned,
not to exalt the praises of Martyn; for had he been
a perfect man, they would have appeared too insignificant
to affect him at all, but to show that God
gives strength to those who serve Him, and depend
upon Him, proportionate to their trials and necessities;
that his grace can enable a man to do actions
of benevolence, which no other influence could;
and that the sacrifices which Martyn made, are a
proof of the reality of religion, as well as of the
sincerity of his own profession. Let the person
who is now reading this page, stop here, and ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
whether he would be willing to leave his parents,
friends, and home to-morrow, and go to live
amongst a population of half-savage people, sixteen
thousand miles from his home, and spend the
whole of his life in teaching them to read, and persuading
them to believe the gospel; to be all this
time subject to abuse and ridicule, from most of
these people; to be exposed to weak health and
early death, and to do all this, merely and solely
because, if a single one is converted, it would
promote the glory of God by bringing one more
soul to acknowledge Him, and make that soul
happy for ever. Let the reader, who has now his
eye upon these words, seriously ask what would
induce <em>him</em> or <em>her</em> to do this; and then think, if you
are not willing at once to act thus, what it is that is
wanting in you. You will find that religion is indeed
a reality: that the Bible is indeed true, which
declares that God will surely make willing and able,
all who put their trust in Him, to perform whatever
his providence calls them to do. If you profess
to be a follower of Christ and to seek the advancement
of his kingdom, are you doing all you can for
this object, or are you waiting for the judgment,
supposing that Christ will acknowledge a professed,
but unprofitable servant?</p>

<p>From Cornwall, Mr. Martyn returned to Cambridge,
where he continued to assist Mr. Simeon in
his church. Although distressed with the consciousness
of his sinfulness, and unworthiness to be a minister
of Christ, he had comforts also, which assured
him that he had an interest in his Divine Redeemer:
so that he could confidently say, “I wish for no service
but the service of God;—to labour for souls on
earth, and to do his will in heaven;” and at another
time, “O hasten the day when I shall come to thee;
when I shall no more be vexed, and astonished,
and pained, at the universal wretchedness of this
lost earth. But here would I abide my time, and
spend and be spent for the salvation of any poor
soul; lie down at the feet of sinners, and beseech
them not to plunge into an eternity of torment.”
It will be instructive to copy here some pages from
his letters and diary, in which he wrote down the
state of his feelings at this period.</p>

<p>“We should consider it as a sign for good, my
dearest S——, when the Lord reveals to us the
almost desperate corruption of our hearts. For, if
he causes us to groan under it, as an insupportable
burden, he will, we may hope, in his own time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
give us deliverance. The pride which I see dwelling
in my own heart, producing there the most
obstinate hardness, I can truly say my soul abhors.
I see it to be unreasonable, I feel it to be tormenting.
When I sometimes offer up supplications,
with strong crying to God, to bring down my spirit
into the dust, I endeavour calmly to contemplate the
infinite majesty of the most high God, and my own
meanness and wickedness. Or else I quietly tell
the Lord, who knows the heart, that I would give
him all the glory of every thing, if I could. But the
most effectual way I have ever found, is to lead away
my thoughts from myself and my own concerns,
by praying for all my friends; for the church, the
world, the nation; and especially by beseeching,
that God would glorify his own great name, by
converting all nations to the obedience of faith;—also
by praying that he would put more abundant
honour on those Christians whom he seems to have
honoured especially, and whom we see to be manifestly
our superiors. This is at least a positive act
of humility, and it is certain that not only will a
good principle produce a good act, but the act will
increase the principle. But even after doing all
this, there will often arise a certain self-complacency
which has need to be checked; and in conversation
with Christian friends, we should be careful,
I think, how self is introduced. Unless we think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
that good will be done, self should be kept in the
back ground, and mortified. We are bound to be
servants of all, ministering to their pleasure as far
as will be to their profit. We are to ‘look not at
our own things, but at the things of others.’ Be
assured, my dear S—— that night and day, making
mention of you in my prayers, I desire of God to
give you to see the depth of pride and iniquity in
your heart, yet not to be discouraged at the sight
of it: that you may perceive yourself deserving to
be cast out with abhorrence from God’s presence;
and then may walk in continual poverty of spirit,
and the simplicity of a little child. Pray, too, that
I may know something of humility. Blessed grace!
how it smooths the furrows of care, and gilds the
dark paths of life! It will make us kind, tender-hearted,
affable, and enable us to do more for God
and the gospel, than the most fervent zeal without
it.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 30th, 1804.</em>—My mind, this morning,
easily ascended to God, in peaceful solemnity. I
succeeded in finding access to God, and being alone
with him. Could I but enjoy this life of faith more
steadily, how much should I ‘grow in grace,’ and
be renewed in the spirit of my mind. At such seasons
of fellowship with the Father, and his Son
Jesus Christ, when the world, and self, and eternity,
are nearly in their right places, not only are my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
views of duty clear and comprehensive, but the
proper motives have a more constraining influence.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 28th.</em>—This has been in general a happy
day. In the morning, through grace, I was enabled
by prayer to maintain a calm recollection of myself,—and
what was better, of the presence of my
dear Redeemer. From the church I walked to our
garden, where I was above an hour, I trust with
Christ, speaking to him chiefly of my future life in
his service. I determined on entire devotedness,
though with trembling; for the flesh dreads crucifixion.
But should I fear pain, when Christ was
so agonized for me? No,—come what will, I am
determined, through God, to be a fellow worker
with Christ. I recollected with comfort, that I was
speaking to the great Creator, who can make such
a poor weak worm as myself ‘more than conqueror.’
At church I found by the attention of the people,
that the fervour of my spirit yesterday had been
conveyed into my sermon. I came to my room,
rejoicing to be alone again, and to hold communion
with God.”</p>

<p>“<em>Dec. 9th.</em>—This has been in general a sweet
and blessed day,—a foretaste of my eternal sabbath.
Preached on the third commandment: in the afternoon
on the tenth. Rode back to Cambridge, feeling
quite willing to go any where, or to suffer any
thing for God. Preached in Trinity church, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Ezek. xxxiii. 11. ‘Say unto them,—As I live
saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death
of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his
way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil
ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?’ It
was pleasant to me to think of being alone again
with God.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 1, 1805.</em>—Hitherto hath the Lord helped
me. It is now about five years since God stopped
me in the career of worldliness, and turned me from
the paths of sin:—three years and a half since I
turned to the Lord with all my heart:—and a little
more than two years since he enabled me to devote
myself to his service as a missionary. My progress
of late has become slower than it had been: yet I
can truly say, that in the course of this time, every
successive year, every successive week, has been
happier than the former. From many dangerous
snares hath the Lord preserved me: in spite of all
my inward rebellion, he hath carried on his work
in my heart; and in spite of all my unbelieving
fears, he hath given me a hope full of immortality;—‘he
hath set my foot on a rock, and established
my goings, and hath put a new song in my mouth,
even praises to my God.’ It is the beginning of a
critical year to me: yet I feel little apprehension.
The same grace and long suffering, the same wisdom
and power, that have brought me so far, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
bring me on, though it be through fire and water,
to a goodly heritage. I see no business in life but the
work of Christ, neither do I desire any employment
to all eternity but his service. I am a sinner saved
by grace. Every day’s experience convinces me
of this truth. My daily sins and constant corruption
leave me no hope, but that which is founded
on God’s mercy in Christ. His spirit, I trust, is
imparted, and is renewing my nature; as I desire
much, though I have attained but little. Now to
God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, would I
solemnly renew my self-dedication, to be his servant
for ever.”</p>

<p>“I could not help reflecting on the almost supernatural
fervour and deep devotion which came upon
me, whilst I declared that I had rightfully no other
business each day but to do God’s work as a servant,
constantly regarding his pleasure.” “My
thoughts were full of what God would do for his
own glory, in the conversion of multitudes to himself
in the latter day. I did not wish to think
about myself in any respect, but found it a precious
privilege to stand by, a silent admirer of God’s
doings.”</p>

<p>In March 1805, he completed the time required,
before he could be sent out as a minister, and there
was nothing more to detain him from proceeding
on his mission. “I rejoice to say,” (he wrote at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
this time to his sister,) “that I never had so clear
a conviction of my call as at present,—as far as it
respects the inward impression. Never did I see
so much the exceeding excellency, and glory, and
sweetness of the work, nor had so much the favourable
testimony of my own conscience, nor perceived
so plainly the smile of God. I am constrained to
say,—what am I, or what is my father’s house,
that I should be made willing;—what am I, that I
should be so happy, so honoured?”—In his Journal,
likewise, he expresses himself to the same effect:
“I felt more persuaded of my call than ever: there
was scarcely the shadow of a doubt left;—rejoice,
O my soul,—thou shalt be the servant of God in
this life, and in the next, for all the boundless ages
of eternity.”</p>

<p>In April he went to London, where he remained
two months, principally employed in learning Hindoostanee,
the language of a large part of India,
made up of the Sanscrit, Persian, and Arabic.
The entries of his diary during this interval will
best exhibit the state of his heart, in anticipation
of his employment.</p>

<p>“<em>April 15th.</em>—O may God confirm my feeble
resolutions! What have I to do but to labour, and
pray, and fast, and watch, for the salvation of my
own soul, and those of the heathen world. Ten
thousand times more than ever do I feel devoted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
that precious work. O gladly shall this base blood
be shed, every drop of it, if India can be benefited in
one of her children;—if but one of those children
of God Almighty might be brought home to his
duty.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 16th.</em>—How careful should I, and all be,
in our ministry, not to break the bruised reed! Alas!
do I think that a schoolboy, a raw academic, should
be likely to lead the hearts of men?—what a
knowledge of men, and acquaintance with the
Scriptures, what communion with God, and study
of my own heart, ought to prepare me for the awful
work of a messenger from God on the business
of the soul!”</p>

<p>“<em>April 22d.</em>—I do not wish for any heaven
upon earth besides that of preaching the precious
Gospel of Jesus Christ to immortal souls. May
these weak desires increase and strengthen with
every difficulty.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 27th.</em>—My constant unprofitableness
seemed to bar my approach to God. But I considered
that for all that was past, the blood of
Christ would atone; and that for the future, God
would that moment give me grace to perform my
duty.”</p>

<p>“<em>May 9th.</em>—O my soul, when wilt thou live
consistently? When shall I walk steadily with
God? When shall I hold heaven constantly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
view? How time glides away,—how is death approaching,—how
soon must I give up my account,—how
are souls perishing,—how does their blood
call out to us to labour and watch, and pray for
them that remain!”</p>

<p>“<em>June 1.</em>—Memory has been at work to unnerve
my soul: but reason, and honour, and love to Christ
and souls shall prevail. Amen. God help me.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 2.</em>—My dear Redeemer is a fountain of
life to my soul. With resignation and peace can I
look forward to a life of labour and entire seclusion
from earthly comforts, while Jesus thus stands near
me, changing me into his own image.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 6th.</em>—God’s interference in supporting
me continually, appears to me like a miracle.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 7th.</em>—I have not felt such heart-rending
pain since I parted with L—— in Cornwall. [The
lady to whom he was attached.] But the Lord
brought me to consider the folly and wickedness
of all this. I could not help saying,—Go, Hindoos,
go on in your misery,—let Satan still reign over
you; for he that was appointed to labour among
you, is consulting his ease.—No, thought I, earth
and hell shall never keep me back from my work.
I am cast down, but not destroyed. I began to consider
why I was so uneasy,—‘Cast thy care upon
him, for he careth for you.’ ‘In every thing by
prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
requests be made known to God;’—these promises
were sweetly fulfilled, before long, to me.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 4th.</em>—Mr. Cecil showed me a letter in
Swartz’s own hand writing. Its contents were of
a very experimental nature,—applicable to my case.
The life of faith in Jesus is what I want. My soul
might almost burst with astonishment at its own
wickedness! but at the same time, trusting to mercy,
rise and go, and try to make men happy. The
Lord go with me! Let my right hand forget her
cunning, if I remember not Jerusalem above my
chief joy.”</p>

<p>On the 8th of July 1805, Mr. Martyn proceeded
to Portsmouth, from which place he was to sail in a
ship of the East India Company, to Calcutta, there
to act as chaplain of the Company. His feelings
were so painful, that he fainted and fell into a fit
at a tavern on the road. He was met by a number
of friends at Portsmouth, who had come to bid him
a final farewell, for this life; and he received there
a silver compass, sent by his congregation, as a
token of remembrance, which he acknowledged in
the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<em>Portsmouth, July 11, 1805.</em><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“<em>My dearest Brethren</em>,—I write in great haste
to thank you most affectionately for the token of
your love, which our dear brother and minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
has given me from you. O may my God richly
recompense you for your great affection! May he
reward your prayers for me, by pouring tenfold
blessings into your own bosoms! May he bless
you with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus!
At the command of God, as I believe, I shall, in a
few hours, embark for those regions where your
little present may be of use to me, in guiding my
way through the trackless desert. I pray that the
word of God, which is your compass, may, through
the Spirit, direct your path through the wilderness
of this world, and bring you in safety to the better
country above. I beg your prayers, and assure
you of mine. Remember me sometimes at your
social meetings, and particularly at that which you
hold on the Sabbath morning. Pray not only for
my sinful soul,—that I may be kept faithful unto
death;—but especially, for the souls of the poor
Heathen. Whether I live or die, let Christ be
magnified by the ingathering of multitudes to himself.
I have many trials awaiting me, and so have
you; but that covenant of grace in which we are
interested, provides for the weakest, and secures
our everlasting welfare.—Farewell, dear Brethren!
May God long continue to you the invaluable labours
of your beloved minister; and may you, with
the blessing of his ministry, grow, day by day, in
all spirituality and humility of mind; till God, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
his mercy, shall call you, each in his own time, to
the eternal enjoyment of his glory.”</p>

<p>On the 17th July the ship sailed, in company with
a fleet, taking an army to India. “It was a very
painful moment,” he wrote to one of his friends,
“when I awoke, on the morning after you left us,
and found the fleet actually sailing down the channel.
Though it was what I had anxiously been
looking forward to so long, yet the consideration
of being parted for ever from my friends, almost
overcame me. My feelings were those of a man
who should suddenly be told, that every friend he
had in the world was dead. It was only by prayer
for them that I could be comforted; and this was
indeed a refreshment to my soul, because by meeting
them at the throne of grace, I seemed to be
again in their society.”</p>

<p>The vessel, however, unexpectedly stopped in
two days, at Falmouth, an English port, in sight of
Cornwall. It was a renewal of the pain of separation
to be thus brought again, for a short time, upon
the shores which he had supposed he had left for
ever. He appears, from his Journal, to have suffered
great struggles with his earthly affections:
but he was supported by Him who never leaves
his disciples to contend alone with the trials of
their faith.</p>

<p>“<em>July 29th.</em>—I was much engaged, at intervals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
in learning the hymn, ‘The God of Abraham
praise;’ as often as I could use the language of it
with any truth, my heart was a little at ease.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The God of Abraham praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At whose supreme command</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From earth I rise, and seek the joys</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At his right hand.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I all on earth forsake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Its wisdom, fame, and power;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And him my only portion make,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My shield and tower.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There was something peculiarly solemn and
affecting to me in this hymn, and particularly at
this time. The truth of the sentiments I knew
well enough. But alas! I felt that the state of
mind expressed in it was above mine at the time;
and I felt loth to forsake all on earth.”</p>

<p>“I went on board in extreme anguish, and found
an opportunity in the sloop by which I passed to
the ship, to cry, with brokenness of spirit, to the
Lord. The words, ‘Why sayest thou, O Jacob,
and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the
Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my
God?’ were brought to my mind with such force,
that I burst into a flood of tears, and felt much relieved
in my soul, by the thought that God was
thus compassionate, and the blessed Lord Jesus a
merciful and compassionate High Priest, who condescended
to sympathize with me. In the afternoon,
it pleased God to give me a holy and blessed season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
in prayer, in which my soul recovered much
of its wonted peace.”</p>

<p>Orders for the sailing of the fleet with which his
ship was connected, were given on the 10th of August,
whilst Martyn was twenty miles in the country.
An express was sent after him; but had not
an accident happened to the ship in clearing from
the harbour, he would have been too late. On the
14th, the fleet anchored again for two weeks, at
Cork, in Ireland. He had suffered much from
despondence and weakness of health, and speaks in
his Journal of the trials of his lot as being far greater
than he had expected. But he was blessed also
with spiritual consolation, in proportion as he placed
his confidence on Him who called him to the
service. On one occasion he says,</p>

<p>“After a long and blessed season in prayer, I felt
the spirit of adoption drawing me very near to God,
and giving me the full assurance of his love. My
fervent prayer was, that I might be more deeply
and habitually convinced of his unchanging everlasting
love, and that my whole soul might be altogether
in Christ. I scarcely knew how to express
the desires of my heart. I wanted to be all in
Christ, and to have Christ for my ‘all in all;’—to
be encircled in his ‘everlasting arms, and to be
swallowed up altogether in his fulness. I wished
for no created good, nor for men to know my experience:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
but to be one with thee, and live for
thee, O God, my Saviour and Lord. O may it be
my constant care to live free from the spirit of bondage,
at all times having access to the Father. This
I feel should be the state of the Christian: perfect
reconciliation with God, and a perfect appropriation
of him in all his endearing attributes, according to
all that he has promised: it is this that shall bear
me safely through the storm.”</p>

<p>And some weeks afterwards:</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 23.</em>—We are just to the south of all Europe,
and I bid adieu to it for ever, without a wish
of ever revisiting it, and still less with any desire
of taking up my rest in the strange land to which
I am going. Ah! no,—farewell, perishing world!
‘To me, to live shall be Christ.’ I have nothing
to do here, but to labour as a stranger, and by secret
prayer and outward exertion, do as much as possible
for the church of Christ and my own soul, till
my eyes close in death, and my soul wings its way
to a brighter world. Strengthen me, O God my Saviour!
that, whether living or dying, I may be thine.”</p>

<p>He preached once every Sunday on board the
ship, the captain not permitting it more frequently.
To make up for this loss, he almost daily read religious
books, with remarks of his own, to as many
as would assemble to hear him; but he could gain
the serious attention of very few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 10th.</em>—Endeavoured to consider what
should be my study and preparation for the mission;
but could devise no particular plan, but to
search the Scriptures, what are God’s promises
respecting the spread of the gospel, and of the
means by which it shall be accomplished. Long
seasons of prayer in behalf of the heathen, I am
sure, are necessary; Isaiah lxii. I began Isaiah,
and learnt by heart the promises scattered through
the first twelve chapters, hoping it may prove profitable
matter for meditation as well as prayer.
Read the Pilgrim’s Progress, below, amidst the
greatest noise and interruption. Notwithstanding
the clamour, I felt as if I could preach to a million
of noisy persons with unconquerable boldness. We
have been becalmed the whole day. I fear my soul
has been much in the same state: but I would not
that it should be so any longer.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 15th.</em>—Sunday.—‘He that testifieth these
things, saith, behold—I come quickly—Amen—even
so—come quickly, Lord Jesus!’ Happy
John! though shut out from society and the ordinances
of grace: happy wast thou in thy solitude,
when by it thou wast induced thus gladly to welcome
the Lord’s words, and repeat them with a
prayer. Read and preached on Acts xiii. 38, 39.
In the latter part, when I was led to speak, without
preparation, on the all-sufficiency of Christ to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
sinners, who come to him with all their sins without
delay, I was enabled by divine aid, to speak
with freedom and energy: my soul was refreshed,
and I retired, seeing reason to be thankful. The
weather was fair and, calm, inviting the mind to
tranquillity and praise: the ship just moved upon
the face of the troubled ocean. I went below in
hopes of reading Baxter’s Call to the Unconverted:
but there was no getting down, as they were taking
out water: so I sat with the seamen on the gun-deck.
As I walked in the evening at sunset, I
thought with pleasure, but a few more suns, and I
shall be where my sun shall no more go down.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 16th.</em>—Two things were much in my
mind this morning in prayer; the necessity of entering
more deeply into my own heart, and labouring
after humiliation, and, for that reason, setting
apart times for fasting: as also to devote times for
solemn prayer for fitness in the ministry; especially
love for souls; and for the effusion of the Spirit
on heathen lands; according to God’s command.”</p>

<p>The study of the Hindoostanee language was part
of his employment during the voyage. He also
instructed some of the young soldiers in mathematics,
and read French with a passenger. As they
entered the warm latitudes, he found his strength
diminishing very fast, and he began to fear he could
never be useful, as a preacher, in India. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
what means this anxiety?” he said; “Is it not of
God that I am led into outward difficulties, that my
faith may be tried? Suppose,” (addressing himself,)
“you are obliged to return, or that you never see
India, but wither and die here, what is that to you?
Do the will of God where you can, and leave the
rest to him.”—About this time he was much impressed
with this sentence in Milner’s Church History;—“to
believe, to suffer, and to love, was the
primitive taste;” and he received great encouragement
by being thus led to contemplate the examples
of those who had been more bold in serving Christ.</p>

<p>The fleet touched at several ports on their way.
Some portions of his Journal at St. Salvador, in
South America, will give an interesting variety to
our pages.</p>

<p>“I continued my walk in quest of a wood, or
some trees where I might sit down; but all was
appropriated: no tree was to be approached except
through an enclosure. At last I came to a magnificent
porch, before a garden gate, which was open,
I walked in, but finding the vista led straight to the
house, I turned to the right, and found myself in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
grove of cocoa-nut trees, orange trees, and several
strange fruit trees; under them was nothing but
rose trees, but no verdure on the ground: oranges
were strewed like apples in an orchard. Perceiving
that I was observed by the slaves, I came up
to the house, and was directed by them to an old
man sitting under a tree, apparently insensible from
illness. I spoke to him in French and in English,
but he took no notice. Presently a young man
and a young lady appeared, to whom I spoke in
French, and was very politely desired to sit down
at a little table, which was standing under a large
space before the house like a veranda. They
then brought me oranges, and a small red acid
fruit, the name of which I asked, but cannot recollect.
The young man sat opposite, conversing
about Cambridge; he had been educated in a Portuguese
University. Almost immediately on finding
I was of Cambridge, he invited me to come
when I liked to his house. A slave, after bringing
the fruit, was sent to gather three roses for me;
the master then walked with me round the garden,
and showed me, among the rest, the coffee-plant:
when I left him he repeated his invitation. His
name was Antonio Corrè.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 14th.</em>—Sennor Antonio received me with
the same cordiality: he begged me to dine with
him. In the cool of the evening, we walked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
to see his plantation; here every thing possessed
the charm of novelty. The grounds included two
hills, and a valley between them. The hills were
covered with cocoa-nut trees, bananas, mangoes,
orange and lemon trees, olives, coffee, chocolate,
and cotton plants, &amp;c. In the valley was a large
plantation of a shrub or tree, bearing a cluster of
small berries, which he desired me to taste; I did,
and found it was pepper. It had lately been introduced
from Batavia, and answered very well.
It grows on a stem about the thickness of a finger,
to the height of about seven feet, and is supported
by a stick, which, at that height, has another across
it for the branches to spread upon. Slaves were
walking about the grounds, watering the trees, and
turning up the earth: the soil appeared very dry
and loose. At night I returned to the ship in
one of the country boats, which are canoes made
of a tree hollowed out, and paddled by three
men.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 18th.</em>—Went ashore at six o’clock, and
found that Sennor Antonio had been waiting for me
two hours. It being too late to go into the country,
I staid at his house till dinner. He kept me too
much in his company, but I found intervals for retirement.
In a cool and shady part of the garden,
near some water, I sat and sang—‘O’er the
gloomy hills of darkness.’ I could read and pray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
aloud, as there was no fear of any one understanding
me.</p>

<p>“A slave, in my bed-room, washed my feet. I
was struck with the degree of abasement expressed
in the act, and as he held the foot in the towel,
with his head bowed down towards it, I remembered
the condescension of the blessed Lord. May I
have grace to follow such humility!”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 19th.</em>—Early after breakfast went in a
palanquin to Sennor Dominigo’s, and from thence
with him two or three miles into the country: at
intervals I got out and walked. I was gratified
with the sight of what I wanted to see; namely,
some part of the country in its original state, covered
with wood; it was hilly, but not mountainous.
The luxuriance was so rank, that the whole space,
even to the tops of the trees, was filled with long
stringy shrubs and weeds, so as to make them impervious
and opaque. The road was made by cutting
away the earth on the side of the hill, so that
there were woods above and below us. The object
of our walk was to see a pepper plantation, made
in a valley, on a perfect level. The symmetry of
the trees was what charmed my Portuguese friend;
but to me, who was seeking the wild features of
America, it was just what I did not want. The
person who showed us the grounds, was one that
had been a major in the Portuguese army, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
retired on a pension. The border consisted of
pine apples, planted between each tree; the interior
was set with lemon trees, here and there, between
the pepper plants. We were shown the root
of the mandioc, called by us tapioca; it was like a
large horse radish; the mill for grinding it was
extremely simple; a horizontal wheel, turned by
horses, put in motion a vertical one, on the circumference
of which was a thin brazen plate, furnished
on the inside like a nutmeg grater; a slave held
the root to the wheel, which grated it away, and
threw it in the form of a moist paste, into a receptacle
below: it is then dried in pans, and used as
a farina with meat. At Sennor Antonio’s, a plate
of tapioca was attached to each of our plates. Some
of the pepper was nearly ripe, and of a reddish appearance;
when gathered, which it is in April, it
is dried in the sun.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 23.</em>—In the afternoon took leave of my
kind friends Sennor and Sennora Corrè. They and
the rest came out to the garden gate, and continued
looking, till the winding of the road hid me from
their sight. The poor slave Raymond, who had
attended me and carried my things, burst into a
flood of tears, as we left the door; and when I
parted from him, he was going to kiss my feet;
but I shook hands with him, much affected by such
extraordinary kindness, in people to whom I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
been a total stranger, till within a few days.
What shall I render unto the Lord for all his
mercies?”</p>

<p>It had lately been announced to the army which
was carried in the fleet, that they were to be led to
attack the cape of Good Hope, then held by the
Dutch. This intelligence, which had been kept
secret, until they were approaching the cape, excited
Mr. Martyn to be more active in the service
of these men, who were soon to be exposed to the
dangers of warfare, and many of whom would, probably,
be sent to eternity. He observed a day of
fasting and prayer in their behalf, addressed them
from the scriptures whenever he had opportunity,
and several were induced to kneel publicly in
prayer with him, notwithstanding the ridicule and
carelessness of the greater part of the crew and
soldiers. During a season of great sickness on
board his ship, at which time the captain died, he
was very useful in attending to the wants of the
sick, and leading their minds to consider the necessity
of preparation for eternity. On the last Sunday
of this year he preached a sermon, adapted to their
circumstances, from 2 Pet. iii. 11. “Seeing then
that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation
and godliness:” in which he endeavoured to
impress his hearers with a sense of the importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of religion, reminding them of the ways by which
Providence had been calling them to reflection, by
the prevalence of disease, the death of their captain,
the dangers of the voyage, and the prospect of being
engaged in battle. His own mind enjoyed great
peace at this time, as is evident from his diary.</p>

<p>“Separated from my friends and country for
ever, there is nothing to distract me from hearing
‘the voice of my beloved,’ and coming away from
this world, and walking with him in love, amidst
the flowers that perfume the air of paradise, and
the harmony of the happy, happy saints who are
singing his praise. Thus hath the Lord brought
me to the conclusion of the year; and though I have
broken his statutes, and not kept his commandments,
yet he hath not utterly taken away his
loving kindness, nor suffered his truth to fail. I
thought, at the beginning of the year, that I should
have been in India at this time, if I should have
escaped all the dangers of the climate. These
dangers are yet to come; but I can leave all cheerfully
to God. If I am weary of any thing, it is of
my life of sinfulness. I want a life of more devotion
and holiness; and yet am so vain, as to be expecting
the end without the means. I am far
from regretting that I ever came on this delightful
work; were I to choose for myself, I could scarcely
find a situation more agreeable to my taste. On,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
therefore, let me go, and persevere steadily in this
blessed undertaking: through the grace of God,
dying daily to the opinions of men, and aiming,
with a more single eye, at the glory of the everlasting
God.”</p>

<p>On the third of January 1806, the fleet anchored
at the cape, and the army was landed, and led to
the attack, which commenced early the next morning.
As soon as the battle was over, Mr. Martyn
went on shore, in hopes of being useful to the sufferers.
His own account of the scene, in a letter
to a friend in England, gives a terrible picture of a
field of battle.</p>

<p>“I embraced the opportunity of getting to the
wounded men, soon after my landing. A party of
the company’s troops were ordered to repair to the
field of battle, to bring away the wounded, under
the command of Major ——, whom I knew. By
his permission, I attached myself to them, and
marched six miles over a soft burning sand, till we
reached the fatal spot. We found several but
slightly hurt; and these we left for a while, after
seeing their wounds dressed by a surgeon. A little
onward were three mortally wounded. One of
them, on being asked where he was struck, opened
his shirt and showed a wound in his left breast.
The blood which he was spitting, showed that he
had been shot through the lungs. As I spread my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
great coat over him, by the surgeon’s desire, who
passed on without attempting to save him, I spoke
of the blessed gospel, and besought him to look to
Jesus Christ for salvation. He was surprised, but
could not speak; and I was obliged to leave him,
in order to reach the troops, from whom the officers,
out of regard to my safety, would not allow
me to be separated. Among several others, some
wounded, and some dead, was Captain ——; who
was shot by a rifleman. We all stopped for a
while, to gaze, in pensive silence, on his pale body,
and then passed on, to witness more proofs of the
sin and misery of fallen man. Descending into
the plain, where the main body of each army had
met, I saw some of the fifty-ninth, one of whom, a
corporal, who sometimes had sung with us, told
me that none of the fifty-ninth were killed, and
none of the officers wounded. Some farm-houses,
which had been in the rear of the enemy’s army,
had been converted into an hospital for the wounded,
whom they were bringing from all quarters.
The surgeon told me that there were already in the
houses two hundred, some of whom were Dutch.
A more ghastly spectacle than that which presented
itself here, I could not have conceived. They
were ranged without and within the house, in rows,
covered with gore. Indeed, it was the blood, which
they had not had time to wash off, that made their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
appearance more dreadful than the reality: for few
of their wounds were mortal. The confusion was
very great: and sentries and officers were so strict
in their duty, that I had no fit opportunity of speaking
to any of them, except a Dutch captain, with
whom I conversed in French. After this, I walked
out again with the surgeon to the field, and saw
several of the enemy’s wounded. A Hottentot,
who had had his thigh broken by a ball, was lying
in extreme agony, biting the dust, and uttering horrid
imprecations upon the Dutch. I told him that
he ought to pray for his enemies; and after telling
the poor wretched man of the gospel, I begged him
to pray to Jesus Christ. But our conversation was
soon interrupted; for, in the absence of the surgeon,
who was gone back for his instruments, a
highland soldier came up, and challenged me with
the words, ‘Who are you?’ ‘An Englishman.’
‘No,’ said he, ‘you are French,’ and began to present
his piece. As I saw that he was rather intoxicated,
and did not know but that he might actually
fire, out of mere wantonness, I sprang up
towards him, and told him, that if he doubted my
word, he might take me as his prisoner to the
English camp,—but that I certainly was an English
clergyman. This pacified him, and he behaved
with great respect. The surgeon, on examining
the wound, said the man must die, and so left him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
At length, I found an opportunity of returning, as
I much wished, in order to recover from distraction
of mind, and to give free scope to reflection. I lay
down on the border of a clump of shrubs or bushes,
with the field of battle in view, and there lifted up
my soul to God. Mournful as the scene was, I
yet thanked God that he had brought me to see a
specimen, though a terrible one, of what men by
nature are. May the remembrance of this day ever
excite me to pray and labour more for the propagation
of the gospel of peace. Then shall men love
one another: nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
The blue mountains, to the eastward, which formed
the boundary of the prospect, were a cheering
contrast to what was immediately before me; for
there I conceived my beloved and honoured fellow
servants,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> companions in the kingdom and patience
of Jesus Christ, to be passing the days of their
pilgrimage, far from the world, imparting the truths
of the precious gospel to benighted souls. May I
receive grace to be a follower of their faith and patience;
and do you pray, my brother, as I know
that you do, that I may have a heart more warm,
and a zeal more ardent in this glorious cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>On the tenth, the fort and town were taken from
the Dutch. Whilst the fleet was delayed, Martyn
visited Dr. Vanderkemp, and the other missionaries
at the cape, and his meeting with them was a
source of great joy.</p>

<p>“From the first moment I arrived, I had been
anxiously inquiring about Dr. Vanderkemp. I
heard at last, to my no small delight, that he was
now in Cape Town. But it was long before I
could find him. At length I did. He was standing
outside of the house, silently looking up at the
stars. A great number of black people were sitting
around. On my introducing myself, he led me in,
and called for Mr. Read. I was beyond measure
delighted at the happiness of seeing him too. The
circumstance of meeting with these beloved and
highly honoured brethren, so filled me with joy
and gratitude for the goodness of God’s providence,
that I hardly knew what to do.”</p>

<p>“<em>January 14th.</em>—Continued walking with Mr.
Read till late. He gave me a variety of curious
information respecting the mission. He told me
of his marvellous success amongst the heathen;
how he had heard them amongst the bushes pouring
out their hearts to God. At all this my ‘soul did
magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoiced in God
my Saviour.’ Now that I am in a land where the
Spirit of God appears, as in the ancient days, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
in the generation of old, let a double portion of that
Spirit rest upon this unworthy head, that I may go
forth to my work ‘rejoicing like a strong man, to
run my race.’”</p>

<p>“<em>January 20th.</em>—Walking home, I asked Dr.
Vanderkemp if he had ever repented of his undertaking.
No, said the old man, smiling, and I
would not exchange my work for a kingdom.
Read told me some of his trials; he has often been
so reduced, for want of clothes, as scarcely to have
any to cover him. The reasonings of his mind
were,—I am here, Lord, in thy service; why am
I left in this state? It seemed to be suggested to
him, If thou wilt be my servant, be contented to
fare in this way; if not, go, and fare better. His
mind was thus satisfied to remain God’s missionary,
with all its concomitant hardships. At night,
my sinful soul enjoyed a most reviving season in
prayer; I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, and pleaded
with fervour for the interests of his church.”</p>

<p>“<em>January 30th.</em>—Rose at five, and began to ascend
Table mountain at six, with S—— and
M——; I went on chiefly alone. I thought of
the Christian life,—what uphill work it is,—and
yet there are streams flowing down from the top,
just as there was water coming down by the Kloof,
by which we ascended. Towards the top it was
very steep, but the hope of being soon at the summit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
encouraged me to ascend very lightly. As the
kloof opened, a beautiful flame-coloured flower appeared
in a little green hollow, waving in the
breeze. It seemed to be an emblem of the beauty
and peacefulness of heaven, as it shall open upon
the weary soul, when its journey is finished, and
the struggles of the death-bed are over. We walked
up and down the whole length, which might be
between two and three miles, and one might be
said to look round the world from this promontory.
I felt a solemn awe at the grand prospect, from
which there was neither noise nor small objects to
draw off my attention. I reflected, especially when
looking at the immense expanse of sea on the east,
which was to carry me to India, on the certainty
that the name of Christ should, at some period, resound
from shore to shore. I felt commanded to
wait in silence, and see how God would bring his
promises to pass. We began to descend at half
past two. Whilst sitting to rest myself, towards
night, I began to reflect, with death-like despondency,
on my friendless condition. Not that I
wanted any of the comforts of life, but I wanted
those kind friends who loved me, and in whose
company I used to find so much delight after my
fatigues. And then, remembering that I should
never see them more, I felt one of those keen
pangs of misery, that occasionally shoot across my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
breast. It seemed like a dream, that I had actually
undergone banishment from them for life; or rather
like a dream, that I had ever hoped to share
the enjoyments of social life. But, at this time, I
solemnly renewed my self-dedication to God, praying
that I might receive grace to spend my days
for his service, in continued suffering, and separation
from all I held most dear in this life: Amen.
How vain and transitory are those pleasures which
the worldliness of my heart will ever be magnifying
into real good!—The rest of the evening, I felt
weaned from the world and all its concerns, with
somewhat of a melancholy tranquillity.”</p>

<p>“<em>January 31.</em>—From great fatigue of body, was
in doubt about going to the hospital, and very unwilling
to go. However, I went, and preached
with more freedom than ever I had done there.
Having some conversation with Colonel H——, I
asked him whether, if the wound he had received
in the late engagement had been mortal, his profaneness
would have recurred with any pleasure to
his mind on a death-bed. He made some attempts
at palliation, though in great confusion; but bore
the admonition very patiently.”</p>

<p>“<em>February 5th.</em>—Rose early; walked out, discouraged
at the small progress I make in the eastern
languages. My state of bodily and mental indolence
was becoming so alarming, that I struggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
hard against both, crying to God for strength. Notwithstanding
the reluctance in my own heart, I
went to the hospital, and preached on Matt. xi. 28;
from this time I enjoyed peace and happiness.
Dr. Vanderkemp called to take leave. I accompanied
him and brother Smith out of the town,
with their two wagons. The dear old man showed
much affection, and gave me advice, and a blessing
at parting. While we were standing to take leave,
Koster, a Dutch missionary, was just entering the
town with his bundle, having been driven from his
place of residence. Brother Read, also, appeared
from another quarter, though we thought he had
gone to sea. These, with Yons,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and myself,
made six missionaries, who, in a few minutes, all
parted again.”</p>

<p>Besides visiting and preaching at the hospital,
among the wounded English, he held public service
at the house in which he lodged. In February
the fleet again sailed: on the 22d of April anchored
before Madras, and in the middle of May, he landed
at Calcutta.</p>

<p>Martyn was much dejected, in contemplating
the vast multitude of idolaters amongst whom he
was now placed.</p>

<p>“Every thing presented the appearance of wretchedness.
I thought of my future labours among
them with some despondency; yet I am willing, I
trust, through grace, to pass my days among them,
if by any means these poor people may be brought
to God. The sight of men, women, and children,
all idolaters, makes me shudder, as if in the dominions
of the prince of darkness. I fancy the
frown of God is visible;—there is something peculiarly
awful in the stillness that prevails. Whether
it is the relaxing influence of the climate, or
what, I do not know; but there is every thing
here to depress the spirits—all nature droops.”</p>

<p>Whilst he almost despaired of the possibility of
ever accomplishing any good himself, he rejoiced
in the promises and prophecies which make it sure,
that at some day, the true God shall be worshipped
there, and in every other place; and the gospel of
Jesus Christ be proclaimed to ‘every nation under
heaven.’ He was animated by the thought, that even
should he never see a native converted, yet it might
be God’s design to encourage future missionaries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
by giving them his example of patience and continuance
in the work. He took up his residence
at Aldeen, near Calcutta, in the house of an English
clergyman; where, after recovering from a dangerous
attack of fever, he experienced great enjoyment
in the company of several Christians,
missionaries and others, established in the neighbourhood.
Strong persuasions were used to induce
him to remain in Calcutta, but that city was supplied
in some measure with the gospel, and it was
his intention to devote himself to more remote heathens.
The celebrated Dr. Buchanan had left
Calcutta on a journey to Syria, at the very time
of Martyn’s arrival, and too soon to know that
God had thus answered the prayers which he and
his brethren had been for some time addressing to
heaven, for the sending of more missionaries to
India.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of October, Mr. Martyn left
Aldeen and Calcutta for Dinapore, a town on the
Ganges, more than three hundred miles distant.
He went in a boat called a budgerow, with a cabin
fitted for travelling; which, as it is moved principally
by towing with poles, does not go farther than
about twenty miles in a day, stopping in the evening.
He employed his time in studying the eastern
languages, in which he was assisted by a native
teacher, called a moonshee, who accompanied him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
He several times witnessed the idolatrous ceremonies
of the people, and made some attempts to
convince them of the sinfulness and folly of the
devotion they paid to idols of their own carving,
and to the river Ganges itself. At several villages
on the route he attempted to speak to the people,
and distributed tracts. Some parts of his own narrative
of this tour, will show how he employed
himself, and how he was upheld in his purpose
amidst all discouragements.</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 19th.</em>—Sunday. The first solitary Sabbath
spent among the heathen: but my soul not
forsaken of God. The prayers of my dear friends
were instant for me this day, I well perceive: and
a great part of my prayer was occupied in delightful
intercession for them. The account of the fall
of man, in the third chapter of Genesis, and of his
restoration by Christ, was unspeakably affecting to
my soul. Indeed, every thing I read seemed to
be carried home to my soul with ineffable sweetness
and power by the Spirit; and all that was
within me blessed His holy name. In the afternoon,
sent to the moonshee, that he might hear the
gospel read, or read it himself. Began St. Mark;—but
our conversation turning from Christianity
to Mohammedism, became deadening to my
spirit. Our course to-day was along the eastern
bank, which seems to have been lately the bed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the river, and is bare of trees for a considerable
distance from the water. The western bank is
covered with wood. In my evening walk saw three
skeletons.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 20th.</em>—Employed all the day in translating
the first chapter of the Acts into Hindoostanee.
I did it with some care, and wrote it all out in the
Persian character; yet still I am surprised I do so
little. I walked into the village where the boat
stopped for the night, and found the worshippers
of Cali by the sound of their drums and cymbals.
I did not think of speaking to them, on account of
their being Bengalees. But, being invited by the
Brahmins<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to walk in, I entered within the railing,
and asked a few questions about the idol. The
Brahmin, who spoke bad Hindoostanee, disputed
with great heat, and his tongue ran faster than I
could follow; and the people, who were about one
hundred, shouted applause. But I continued to
ask my questions, without making any remarks
upon the answers. I asked, among other things,
whether what I had heard of Vishnu and Brahma
was true; which he confessed. I forbore to press
him with the consequences, which he seemed to
feel; and then I told him what was my belief.—The
man grew quite mild, and said it was <em>chula
bat</em> (good words;) and asked me seriously, at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
what I thought—‘was idol worship true or false?’
I felt it a matter of thankfulness that I could make
known the truth of God, though but a stammerer;
and that I had declared it in the presence of the
devil. And this also I learnt, that the power of
gentleness is irresistible. I never was more astonished
than at the change in deportment of this hot-headed
Brahmin.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 21.</em>—Afternoon, with my moonshee, correcting
Acts i., and felt a little discouraged at finding
I still wrote so incorrectly, though much pleased
at this great apparent desire of having it perfectly
accurate. Though not joyful in my spirit, as when
my friends left me, I feel my God to be an all-satisfying
portion, and find no want of friends.
Read Genesis and Luke;—at night in the Septuagint
and Hindoostanee.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 22.</em>—A Brahmin of my own age was performing
his devotions to the Ganges early this
morning, when I was going to prayer. My soul
was struck with the sovereignty of God, who, out
of pure grace, had made such a difference in all
the external circumstances of our lives. O let not
that man’s earnestness rise up in judgment against
me at the last day!—In the afternoon, they were
performing the ceremony of throwing the images
of Cali, collected from several villages, into the
river. In addition to the usual music, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
trumpets. The objects of worship, which were
figures most gorgeously bedecked with tinsel, were
kept under a little awning in their respective boats.
As the budgerow passed through the boats, they
turned, so as to present the front of their goddess
to me; and at the same time, blew a blast with
their trumpet, evidently intending to gratify me
with a sight of what appeared to them so fine. Had
their employment been less impious, I should have
returned the compliment by looking; but I turned
away.”</p>

<p>“Came-to on the eastern bank, below a village
called Ahgadeep. Wherever I walked, the women
fled at the sight of me. Some men were sitting
under the shed dedicated to their goddess; and a
lamp was burning in her place. A conversation
soon began; but there was no one who could
speak Hindoostanee; so all I could say was by the
medium of my mussulman interpreter. They said
that they only did as others did; and that, if they
were wrong, then all Bengal was wrong. I felt
love for their souls, and longed for utterance to declare
unto these poor simple people, the holy gospel.
I think that when my mouth is opened, I
shall preach to them day and night. I feel that
they are my brethren in the flesh;—precisely on a
level with myself.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 25th.</em>—Had a very solemn season of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
prayer, by the favour of God, over some of the
chapters of Genesis; but especially at the conclusion
of the 119th Psalm. O that these holy resolutions
and pious breathings were entirely my own!
Adored be the never-failing mercy of God! He
has made my happiness to depend, not on the uncertain
connexions of this life, but upon his own
most blessed self,—a portion that never faileth.—Came-to
on the eastern bank. The opposite side
was very romantic;—adorned with a stately range
of very high forest trees, whose deep dark shade
seemed impenetrable to the light.—In my evening
walk enjoyed great solemnity of feeling, in the
view of the world as a mere wilderness, through
which the children of God are passing to a better
country. It was a comforting and a solemn thought,
and was unspeakably interesting to me at the time,
that God knew whereabouts his people were in
the wilderness, and was supplying them with just
what they wanted.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 26th.</em>—Sunday. Passed this Lord’s day
with great comfort, and much solemnity of soul.
Glory to God for his grace! Reading the scriptures
and prayer took up the first part of the day.
Almost every chapter I read was blest to my soul;
particularly the last chapter of Isaiah: ‘It shall
come, that I will gather all nations and tongues;
and they shall come, and see my glory,’ &amp;c. Rejoice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
my soul, in the sure promises of Jehovah.
How happy am I, when, in preparing for the work
of declaring his glory among the Gentiles, I think,
that many of the Lord’s saints have been this day
remembering their unworthy friend. I felt as if I
could never be tired with prayer. In the afternoon,
read one of Gilbert’s French Sermons; Bates on
Death; and some of the Nagree Gospels. In the
evening, we came-to on the eastern bank. I walked
into a neighbouring village, with some tracts.
The children ran away in great terror; and though
there were some men here and there, I found no
opportunity or encouragement to try if there were
any that could speak Hindoostanee: however, I
felt vexed with myself for not taking more pains to
do them good. Alas! while Satan is destroying
their souls, does it become the servants of God to
be lukewarm?”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 27th.</em>—Arrived at Berhampore. In the
evening, walked out to see the cantonments at the
hospital, in which there were one hundred and fifty
European soldiers sick. I was talking to a man,
said to be dying, when a surgeon entered. I went
up, and made some apology for entering the hospital.
It was my old school-fellow and townsman,
——. The remainder of the evening he spent
with me in my budgerow. He pressed me much
to stay longer with him, which I refused; but afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
on reflection, I thought it my duty to stay
a little longer; thinking I might have an opportunity
of preaching to the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 28th.</em>—Rose very early, and was at the
hospital at day-light. Waited there a long time,
wandering up and down the wards, in hopes of inducing
the men to get up and assemble; but it was
in vain. I left three books with them, and went
away amidst the sneers and titters of the common
soldiers. Certainly it is one of the greatest crosses
I am called to bear, to take pains to make people
hear me. It is such a struggle between a sense
of propriety and modesty, on the one hand, and a
sense of duty, on the other, that I find nothing
equal to it. I could force my way any where,
in order to introduce a brother minister: but for
myself, I act with hesitation and pain. Mr. ——
promised to ask the head surgeon’s permission for
me to preach, and appointed the hour at which I
should come. I went there: but after waiting two
hours, was told that the surgeon was gone without
being spoken to,—and many other excuses were
made. So, as it was now the heat of the day, I
saw it was of no use to make any more attempts;
and therefore I went on my way.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 2.</em>—Sunday. My mind was greatly oppressed,
that I had done, and was doing nothing in
the way of distributing tracts. To free my conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
from the charge of unprofitableness and
neglect, I wished to go ashore in the middle of the
day, wherever I thought I might meet people; but
did not land till we came-to, on the banks of the
Ganges, which we entered just before sunset.
Walking on shore, I met with a very large party;
and entering into conversation, I asked if any of
them could read. One young man, who seemed
superior in rank to the rest, said he could, and
accordingly read some of the only Nagree tract
that I had. I then addressed myself boldly to
them, and told them of the gospel. When speaking
of the inefficacy of the religious practices of
the Hindoos, I mentioned as an example, the repetition
of the name of Ram. The young man
assented to this; and said ‘of what use is it!’
As he seemed to be of a pensive turn, and said
this with marks of disgust, I gave him a Nagree
Testament;—the first I have given. May God’s
blessing go along with it, and cause the eyes of
multitudes to be opened! The men said they
should be glad to receive tracts; so I sent them
back a considerable number by the young man.
The idea of printing the Parables, in proper order,
with a short explanation subjoined to each, for the
purpose of distribution, and as school-books, suggested
itself to me to-night, and delighted me prodigiously.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 8th.</em>—Early this morning reached Rajemahl,
and walked to view the remains of its ancient
splendour. Gave a tract or two to a Brahmin; but
the Dak moonshee, a Mussulman, when he received
one of the Hindoostanee tracts, and found what
it was, was greatly alarmed: and after many awkward
apologies, returned it, saying that ‘a man who
had his legs in two different boats, was in danger
of sinking between them.’ Went on, much discouraged
at the suspicion and rebuffs I met with,
or rather <em>pained</em>; for I feel not the less determined
to use every effort to give the people the gospel.
Oh! that the Lord would pour out upon them a
spirit of deep concern for their souls! In a walk,
at Rajemahl, met some of the hill people. Wrote
down from their mouth some of the names of things.
From their appearance, they seemed connected with
the Hottentots and Chinese. Passed the day in
correcting Acts, chapter iii. with the moonshee.
At night walked with Mr. G—, into a village,
where we met with some more of the hill people.
With one of them, who was a manghee, or chief
of one of the hills, I had some conversation in
Hindoostanee; and told him that wicked men, after
death, go to a place of fire; and good men, above,
to God. The former struck him exceedingly. He
asked again, ‘What? do they go to a place of great
pain and fire?’ These people, he said, sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
oxen, goats, pigeons, &amp;c. I asked him if he knew
what this was for, and then explained the design
of sacrifices; and told him of the great sacrifice,
but he did not seem to understand me, and appeared
pensive, after hearing that wicked men go
to hell. He asked us, with great kindness, to have
some of his wild honey; which was the only
thing he had to offer. How surprising is the universal
prevalence of sacrifices! This circumstance
will, perhaps, be made use of for the universal
conversion of the nations. How desirable that
some missionary should go among these people!—No
prejudices—none of the detestable pride
and self-righteousness of their neighbours in the
plains.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 9th.</em>—Passed the Sabbath rather uncomfortably.
With Mr. ——, I read several portions
of the sacred scriptures, and prayed in the afternoon.
We reached Sicily gully, a point where
the Rajemahl hills jut out into the Ganges. It
was a romantic spot. We went ashore, and ascended
an eminence to look at the ruins of a
mosque. The grave, and room over it, of a Mussulman
warrior, killed in battle, were in perfect
preservation; and lamps are still lighted there
every night. We saw a few more of the hill
people; one of whom had a bow and arrows;
they were in a hurry to be gone; and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
off, men, women, and children, into their native
woods. As I was entering the boat, I happened
to touch with my stick the brass pot of one of
the Hindoos, in which rice was boiling. So defiled
are we in their sight, that they thought the
pollution passed from my hand, through the stick
and the brass, to the meat. He rose and threw it
all away.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 13th.</em>—This morning we passed Colgong.
I went ashore and had a long conversation
with two men. As I approached more and more
to religion, they were the more astonished; and
when I mentioned the day of judgment, they
looked at each other in the utmost wonder, with
a look that expressed, ‘how should he know any
thing about that?’ I felt some satisfaction in
finding myself pretty well understood in what I
said: but they could not read: and no people
came near us, and so I had the grief of leaving
this place without supplying it with one ray of
light. Looking around this country, and reflecting
upon its state, is enough to overwhelm the
mind of a minister or missionary. When once
my mouth is opened, how shall I ever dare to be
silent? Employed as yesterday. At night met
some boatmen on the bank, and a Fakir with
them: I talked a good deal, and some things they
understood. The Fakir’s words I could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
understand. As he said he could read, and promised
to read a Testament, I gave him one, and
several tracts.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 17th.</em>—Early this morning they set me
ashore to see a hot spring. A great number of
Brahmins and Fakirs<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were there. Not being
able to understand them, I gave away tracts.
Many followed me to the budgerow, where I gave
away more tracts and some Testaments. Arrived
at Monghir about noon. In the evening some
came to me for books; and, among them, those
who had travelled from the spring, having heard
the report that I was giving away copies of the
Ramayuna.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> They would not believe me when
I told them that it was not the Ramayuna; I
gave them six or eight more. In the morning
tried to translate, with the moonshee, one of the
Nagree papers.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 18th.</em>—A man followed the budgerow
along the walls of the fort; and finding an opportunity,
got on board with another, begging for
a book—not believing but that it was the Ramayuna.
As I hesitated, having given as many as I
could spare for one place, he prostrated himself to
the earth, and placed his forehead in the dust; at
which I felt an indescribable horror. I gave them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
each a testament. Employed in writing out the
parables, and translating. In the evening met with
two villagers, and finding they could read, I brought
them to the boat, and gave them each a Testament,
and some tracts.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 19th.</em>—Employed in translating the parables,
all the day. Finished reading the first book
of the Ramayuna. Came-to at a desert place on
the north side; where, in my walk, I met with a
man with whom I conversed; but we could understand
each other but very little. To a boy with
him, who could read, I gave some tracts. Felt
extraordinarily wearied with my labour these two
or three last days; and should have been glad of
some refreshing conversation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn arrived at Dinapore, on the 26th
November: his principal objects, besides discharging
his duties as chaplain to the English residents
there, were to establish schools for the children of
the natives; to learn to speak Hindoostanee; and to
translate the scriptures and religious tracts into
that language, for distribution among the people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
There are so many dialects in India, that it is a
great labour to study the language, so as to be understood
by the inhabitants of different parts of the
country. In these employments he persevered,
though meeting with ridicule and opposition, not
only from the natives, but even from his own irreligious
countrymen, who formed his congregation.
“Let me labour,” he said “for fifty years, amidst
scorn, and without seeing one soul converted; still
it shall not be worse for my soul in eternity, nor
even worse for it in time.” He continued to translate
the parables, with explanations, and devoted
his whole time to preparations for his missionary
work; excepting when he had an opportunity of
personally addressing the natives, who could understand
him, and excepting the time spent with
his English congregation, and the sick at the
hospital.</p>

<p>We have another proof of the reality of religion,
and the truth of the Divine promises, in the manner
in which Martyn was enabled to persist in his
object, in circumstances which would have induced
any other person, than a Christian, to abandon it in
despair. There he stood almost alone, surrounded
by idolaters and Mohammedans, who ridiculed his
attempts to enlighten them; and were not moved
by all his arguments for the religion of Christ.
The English who were settled there, were engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
in trade: and it was a great object with them, that
the natives should be kept ignorant, that they might
be more easily managed in business concerns. Of
course, they would not countenance the plans of
Mr. Martyn, and scarcely treated him with respect.
So solitary was he, amidst persons so different in
feeling from himself, that happening to meet a poor
Jew from Babylon, he said he “felt all the tenderness
of a kinsman towards him, and found himself,
as it were, at home with an Asiatic, who acknowledged
the God of Abraham.” Another source of
consolation, known only to the true follower of
Christ, is thus intimated by him: “O how shall
I sufficiently praise my God, that here in this
solitude, with people enough, indeed, but without
a saint, I yet feel fellowship with all those
who, in every place, call on the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ. I see myself travelling on with
them, and I hope I shall worship with them in His
courts above!”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these obstacles, such was his
conviction of the truth of the gospel, and that it was
his duty to persevere, that the time passed away
rapidly. The nature of the support and consolations,
which he received, may be judged of from
his own expressions, such as these:</p>

<p>“I felt more, entirely withdrawn from the world,
than for a long time past: what a dark atheistical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
state do I generally live in! Alas! that this creation
should so engross my mind, and the author of
it be so slightly and coldly regarded. I found
myself, at this time, truly a stranger and a pilgrim
in the world; and I did suppose that not a wish
remained for any thing here. The experience of
my heart was delightful. I enjoyed a peace that
passeth all understanding; no desire remained, but
that this peace might be confirmed and increased.
O why should any thing draw away my attention,
whilst Thou art ever near, and ever accessible
through the Son of Thy love? O why do I not
always walk with God, forgetful of a vain and perishable
world? Amazing patience! He bears with
this faithless, foolish heart, and suffers me to
come, laden with sins, to receive new pardon, new
grace, every day. Why does not such love make
me hate those sins which grieve him, and hide him
from my sight? I sometimes make vain resolutions,
in my own strength, that I will think of God.
Reason, and scripture, and experience, teach me
that such a life is happiness and holiness; that by
‘beholding his glory,’ I should be changed ‘into
his image, from glory to glory,’ and be freed from
those anxieties which make me unhappy: and that,
every motive to duty being strong, obedience would
be easy.”</p>

<p>He established, at his own expense, five schools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
for the children of the natives, in Dinapore, and
some neighbouring places. We suppose that these
schools were intended to enable the children to read
and write their own language, and to receive instruction
in the Christian religion, so that they
might not grow up in ignorance and idolatry like
their parents. There are two great reasons why
this course is, in all cases, the most proper. First,
because, if the mind is enlightened by education, it
is hard to persuade a person to believe in superstitions.
And the second reason is, that almost all
the feelings and beliefs that men have, are the same
that have been impressed on them in youth, and
have been established in some degree by the power
of habit. It is, therefore, of the highest importance,
that the earliest habits of a child should be good;
and that its instructions should be in the truth; for,
in almost all cases, such a child will, by the blessing
of God, retain his good habits and instructions,
and have them, at length, eternally fixed by religion.
This is the sense of the saying of Solomon—“Train
up a child in the way he should go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it.”</p>

<p>We find the following reflections in Martyn’s
diary of the 1st of January, 1807:</p>

<p>“Seven years have passed away since I was first
called of God. Before the conclusion of another
seven years, how probable is it, that these hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
will have mouldered into dust! But be it so: my
soul, through grace, hath received the assurance of
eternal life, and I see the days of my pilgrimage
shortening, without a wish to add to their number.
But O, may I be stirred up to a faithful discharge
of my high and awful work; and, laying aside, as
much as may be, all carnal cares and studies, may
I give myself to this ‘one thing.’ The last has
been a year to be remembered by me, because the
Lord has brought me safely to India, and permitted
me to begin, in one sense, my missionary work.
My trials in it have been very few: every thing
has turned out better than I expected; loving-kindness
and tender-mercies, have attended me at
every step: therefore, here will I sing his praise.
I have been an unprofitable servant but the Lord
hath not cut me off: I have been wayward and
perverse, yet he has brought me further on the way
to Zion: here, then, with seven-fold gratitude and
affection, would I stop and devote myself to the
blissful service of my adorable Lord. May he
continue his patience, his grace, his direction, his
spiritual influences, and I shall at last surely come
off conqueror! May he speedily open my mouth,
to make known the mysteries of the gospel, and in
great mercy grant that the heathen may receive it
and live!”</p>

<p>In February 1807, Mr. Martyn finished the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
translation of the Episcopal Prayer-book into the
Hindoostanee; and on Sunday, March 15th, used
it in public worship for the first time, concluding
with a short address in that language. About this
time, he also completed his translation and explanation
of the Parables of our Saviour, which he
intended, principally, for the use of the schools, but
postponed for a while, lest it should excite so much
prejudice as to break up the schools entirely.
Every Sunday, he held divine service at seven in
the morning for the English people, and at two in the
afternoon for the natives; after which he visited the
sick in the hospital, and held a prayer-meeting at
his own house in the evening, for some soldiers of
the army, who were willing to attend. These plans
were pursued under much discouragement; the
following is the diary of one Sunday:</p>

<p>“The English service, at seven in the morning.
I preached on Luke xxii. 22. As is always the
case when I preach about Christ, a spiritual influence
was diffused over my soul. The rest of the
morning, till dinner time, I spent, not unprofitably,
in reading scripture, and David Brainerd, and in
prayer. That dear saint of God, David Brainerd,
is truly a man after my own heart. Although I
cannot go half-way with him in spirituality and
devotion, I cordially unite with him in such of his
holy breathings as I have attained unto. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
sweet and wise, like him and the saints of old, to
pass through this world as a serious and considerate
stranger. I have had more of this temper to-day
than of late, and every duty has been in harmony
with my spirit. The service in Hindoostanee was
at two o’clock. The number of women not above
one hundred. I expounded chapter iii. of St.
Matthew. Notwithstanding the general apathy with
which they seemed to receive every thing, there
were two or three who, I was sure, understood and
felt something. But, beside the women, not a single
creature, European or native, was present. Yet
true spirituality, with all its want of attraction for
the carnal heart, did prevail over the splendid shows
of Greece and Rome, and shall again here. A
man at the hospital much refreshed me, by observing,
that if I made an acquisition of but one
convert in my whole life, it would be a rich reward;
and that I was taking the only possible way
to this end.”</p>

<p>There were, however, some of the officers, who
evinced serious feelings; and one was brought to
embrace the offers of salvation. Martyn longed
for the time when he should be qualified to go into
the midst of the Hindoos with the gospel. “O,”
said he, in a letter to Mr. Corrie, missionary at
another station, “that the time were come that I
should be able to carry the war into the enemy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
territory. It will be a severe trial to the flesh, my
dear brother, for us both;—but it is sufficient for
the disciple to be as his master, and the servant as
his Lord. We shall be ‘accounted as the filth of
the world, and the off-scouring of all things.’ But
glory be to God, if we shall be accounted worthy
to suffer shame for the name of the Lord
Jesus.”</p>

<p>His journal of a trip to Monghir, about a hundred
miles distant, shows the distress he felt,
because his zeal was not greater, and because he
was not so holy and spiritual as he desired to be.
He had, no doubt, just reasons for lamenting many
neglected opportunities for doing good, and for deploring
the many wanderings of his heart from
God; but we are not to understand that he was
outwardly wicked or careless, when he speaks of his
condition in such strong language.</p>

<p>“After finishing the correction of the parables, I
left Dinapore to go to Monghir. Spent the evening
at Patna, with Mr. G——, in talking on literary
subjects: but my soul was overwhelmed with a
sense of my guilt, in not striving to lead the
conversation to something that might be for his
spiritual good. My general backwardness to speak
on spiritual subjects before the unconverted, made
me groan in spirit at such unfeelingness and unbelief.
May the remembrance of what I am made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
suffer for these neglects, be one reason for greater
zeal and love in time to come.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 19th.</em>—A melancholy Lord’s day! In
the morning, at the appointed hour, I found some
solemnity and tenderness: the whole desire of my
soul seemed to be, that all the ministers in India
might be eminently holy; and that there might be
no remains of that levity or indolence, in any of
us, which I found in myself. The rest of the day
passed heavily; for a hurricane of hot wind fastened
us on a sand-bank, for twelve hours; while
the dust was suffocating, and the heat increased the
sickness which was produced by the tossing of the
boat, and I frequently fell asleep over my work.
However, the more I felt tempted to impatience
and unhappiness, the more the Lord helped me to
strive against it, and to look to the fulness of Jesus
Christ. Several hymns were very sweet to me—particularly,</p>

<p>“After all the acquisitions of human science,
what is there to be compared with the knowledge
of Christ, and him crucified!—Read much of the
scripture history of Saul, and the predictions in the
latter end of the Revelation.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 21st.</em>—Again the love and mercy of the
Lord restored me to health and spirits. Began to
write a sermon on walking in Christ, and found my
soul benefited by meditation on the subject. In the
afternoon went on with translations. Arrived at
sun-set at Monghir.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 22d.</em>—Spent the day at ——’s. Found
two or three opportunities to speak to him about
his soul. —— threw out some infidel sentiments,
which gave me an opportunity of speaking. But
to none of the rest was I able to say any thing.
Alas! in what a state are mankind every-where—living
without God in the world.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 23d.</em>—I left Monghir, and got on twenty-three
miles toward Dinapore: very sorrowful in
mind, both from the recollection of having done
nothing for the perishing souls I have been amongst,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and from finding myself so unqualified to write
on a spiritual subject, which I had undertaken.
Alas! the ignorance and carnality of my miserable
soul! how contemptible must it be in the sight of
God!”</p>

<p>“<em>April 24th.</em>—Still cast down at my utter inability
to write anything profitable on this subject;
and at my execrable pride and ease of heart. O
that I could weep in the dust, with shame and
sorrow, for my wickedness and folly! Yet thanks
are due to the Lord for showing me, in this way,
how much my heart has been neglected of late.
I see by this, how great are the temptations of a
missionary to neglect his own soul. Apparently
outwardly employed for God, my heart has been
growing more hard and proud. Let me be taught
that the first great business on earth is to obtain
the sanctification of my own soul: so shall I be
rendered more capable also of performing the duties
of the ministry, whether amongst the Europeans or
heathen, in a holy and solemn manner. Oh! how
I detest that levity to which I am so subject! How
cruel and unfeeling is it!—God is my witness that
I would rather, from this day forward, weep day
and night, for the danger of immortal souls. But
my wickedness seems to take such hold of me, that
I cannot escape; and my only refuge is to commit
my soul, with all its corruption, into the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Christ, to be sanctified and saved by His almighty
grace. For what can I do with myself? my heart
is so thoroughly corrupt, that I cannot keep myself
one moment from sin.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 26th.</em>—In prayer, at the appointed hour,
I felt solemnity of mind, and an earnest desire
that the Lord would pour out a double portion
of his Spirit upon us, his ministers in India; that
every one of us may be eminent in holiness and
ministerial gifts. If I were to judge for myself,
I should fear that God had forsaken his church;
for I am most awfully deficient in the knowledge
and experience requisite for a minister; but my
dear brother Corrie, thanks be to God, is a man of
a better spirit: may he grow more and more in
grace, and continue to be an example to us! Passed
the day in reading and prayer, such as my prayers
are. My soul struggled with corruption, yet I found
the merit and grace of Jesus all-sufficient, and all-supporting.
Though my guilt seemed like mountains,
I considered it as no reason for departing
from Christ, but rather for clinging to him more
closely. Thus I got through the day, cast down,
but not destroyed.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 27th.</em>—Left Patna and arrived at Dinapore.
The concourse of people in that great city
was a solemn admonition to me to be diligent in
study and prayer. Thousands of intelligent people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
together; no Sabbath; no word of God; no one
to give them advice: how inscrutable the ways of
God!”</p>

<p>Martyn had made considerable progress in translating
the scriptures into the language of India; he
now, at the suggestion of Mr. Brown, a missionary
near Calcutta, applied himself diligently to finishing
the work, and to oversee, also, a translation
into Persian. This became a delightful employment,
as his own expressions show.</p>

<p>“The time fled imperceptibly, while so delightfully
engaged in the translations; the days seemed
to have passed like a moment. Blessed be God
for some improvement in the languages! May
every thing be for edification in the church! What
do I not owe to the Lord, for permitting me to take
part in a translation of his word: never did I see
such wonder, and wisdom, and love in the blessed
book, as since I have been obliged to study every
expression; and it is a delightful reflection, that
death cannot deprive us of the pleasure of studying
its mysteries.”</p>

<p>“All day on the translations:—employed a good
while at night in considering a difficult passage:
and being much enlightened respecting it, I went
to bed full of astonishment at the wonder of
God’s word: never before did I see any thing
of the beauty of the language and the importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
of the thoughts as I do now. I felt happy that
I should never be finally separated from the contemplation
of them, or of the things about which
they are written. Knowledge shall vanish away,
but it shall be because perfection shall come. Then
shall I see as I am seen, and know as I am known.”</p>

<p>“What a source of perpetual delight have I in
the precious book of God! O that my heart were
more spiritual, to keep pace with my understanding;
and that I could feel as I know! May my
root and foundation be deep in love, and may I be
able to ‘comprehend, with all saints, what is the
breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to
know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge!’
And may I be filled with all the fulness of God!
May the Lord, in mercy to my soul, save me from
setting up an idol of any sort in his place; as I do
by preferring even a work professedly done for
him, to communion with him. How obstinate is
the reluctance of the natural heart to love God!
But, O my soul, be not deceived; thy chief work
upon earth is, to obtain sanctification, and to walk
with God. ‘To obey is better than sacrifice, and
to hearken than the fat of rams.’ Let me learn
from this, that to follow the direct injunctions of
God, as to my own soul, is more my duty, than to
be engaged in other works, under pretence of doing
him service.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“How sweet the retirement in which I here live.
The precious word is now my only study, in the
work of translation. Though, in a manner, buried
to the world,—neither seeing nor seen by Europeans,—the
time flows on here with great rapidity: it
seems as if life would be gone before any thing is
done, or even before any thing is begun. I sometimes
rejoice that I am not twenty-seven years of
age; and that, unless God should order it otherwise,
I may double the number in constant and
successful labour. If not, God has many, many
more instruments at command; and I shall not
cease from my happiness, and scarcely from my
work, by departing into another world. Oh! what
shall separate us from the love of Christ! Neither
death nor life, I am persuaded. Oh! let me feel
my security, that I may be, as it were, already in
heaven; that I may do all my work as the angels
do theirs; and oh! let me be ready for every
work!—be ready to leave this delightful solitude,
or remain in it; to go out, or go in; to stay, or
depart, just as the Lord shall appoint. Lord, let
me have no will of my own; nor consider my true
happiness as depending in the smallest degree on
any thing that can befall my outward man; but as
consisting altogether in conformity to God’s will.
May I have Christ here with me in this world;
not substituting imagination in the place of faith;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
but seeing outward things as they really are,
and thus obtaining a radical conviction of their
vanity.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn now received intelligence from
England of the death of his eldest sister, an event
which very deeply afflicted him; but which caused
him to feel fresh confidence in God, and a new interest
in heaven.</p>

<p>“O great and gracious God! what should I do
without Thee! But now thou art manifesting
thyself as the God of all consolation to my soul:—never
was I so near thee:—I stand on the brink,
and long to take my flight. There is not a
thing in the world for which I could wish to
live, except the hope that it may please God
to appoint me some work. And how shall my
soul ever be thankful enough to thee, O thou
most incomprehensibly glorious Saviour Jesus! O
what hast thou done to alleviate the sorrows of
life! and how great has been the mercy of God
towards my family, in saving us all! How dreadful
would be the separation of relations in death
were it not for Jesus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“The European letter,” he wrote to Mr. Brown,
“contained the intelligence of the death of my
eldest sister. A few lines received from herself
about three weeks ago, gave me some melancholy
forebodings of her danger. But though the Lord
thus compassionately prepared me for this affliction,
I hardly knew how to bear it. We were more
united in affection to each other, than to any of our
relations: and now she is gone, I am left to fulfil,
as a hireling, my day, and then I shall follow her.
She had been many years under some conviction
of her sins, but not till her last illness had she
sought in earnest for salvation. Some weeks before
her death she felt the burden of sin, and cried
earnestly for pardon and deliverance, and continued
in the diligent use of the appointed means
of grace. Two days before her death, when no
immediate danger was apprehended, my youngest
sister visited her; and was surprised and delighted
at the change which had taken place. Her convictions
of sin were deep, and her views clear; her
only fear was on account of her own unworthiness.
She asked, with many tears, whether there was
mercy for one who had been so great a sinner;
though in the eyes of the world she had been an
exemplary wife and mother; and said that she
believed the Lord would have mercy upon her,
because she knew he had wrought on her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
by His Spirit. Two days after this conversation,
she suddenly and unexpectedly left this world of
woe, while her sister was visiting a dying friend at
a distance. This, you will tell me, is precious
consolation; indeed I am constrained to acknowledge
that I could hardly ask for greater; for I had
already parted with her for ever in this life; and,
in parting, all I wished for was, to hear of her
being converted to God, and, if it was his will,
taken away in due time, from the evil to come, and
brought to glory before me. Yet human nature
bleeds; her departure has left this world a frightful
blank to me; and I feel not the smallest wish to
live, except there be some work Assigned for me to
do in the church of God.”</p>

<p>And sometime afterwards he wrote, “My heart
is still oppressed, but it is not ‘a sorrow that
worketh death.’ Though nature weeps at being
deprived of all hopes of ever seeing this dear companion
on earth, faith is thereby brought the more
into exercise. How sweet to feel dead to all below;
to live only for eternity; to forget the short interval
that lies between us and the spiritual world; and
to live always <em>seriously</em>. The <em>seriousness</em> which
this sorrow produces, is indescribably precious; O
that I could always retain it, when these impressions
shall be worn away!”</p>

<p>In September he introduced Christ’s Sermon on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the mount as a lesson for the schools; the first
time he had been privileged to hear the natives
reading and learning any portion of the sacred
scriptures. He declined the urgent request of his
friends in Calcutta, to establish himself there, saying,
that however delightful it would be, to be placed
in the society of the missionaries and their families,
he wished to remain more in the midst of the heathen,
upon whom he desired to expend his labours.
His solitude was also rendered more painful, by
the disappointment of his hopes of marriage with
the lady at Cornwall, to whom he was engaged,
but who now felt obliged to decline the union, for
reasons which Mr. Martyn himself admitted to be
proper. He bore this trial with much meekness:
he said, “The Lord sanctify this: and since this
last desire of my heart is also withheld, may I turn
away for ever from the world, and henceforth live
forgetful of all but God. With thee, O my God,
is no disappointment. I shall never have to regret,
that I have loved thee too well. Thou hast said,
‘delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee
the desires of thy heart.’”</p>

<p>“At first I was more grieved,” he wrote some
time afterwards, “at the loss of my gourd, than
for all the perishing Ninevehs around me; but now
my earthly woes and earthly attachments seem to
be absorbing in the vast concern of communicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the gospel to these nations. After this last lesson
from God on the vanity of the creature, I feel desirous
to be nothing, to have nothing, to ask for
nothing, but what he gives.”</p>

<p>And at the close of the year, he thus spoke of
this event, and the death of his sister:</p>

<p>“On both these afflictions I have seen love inscribed,
and that is enough. What I think I want,
it is better still to want: but I am often wearied
with this world of wo. I set my affections on the
creature, and am then torn from it; and from various
other causes, particularly the prevalence of sin
in my heart, I am often so full of melancholy, that
I hardly know what to do for relief. Sometimes
I say, ‘O that I had wings like a dove, then would
I flee away and be at rest;’ at other times, in my
sorrow about the creature, I have no wish left for
my heavenly rest. It is the grace and favour
of God that have saved me hitherto: my ignorance,
waywardness, and wickedness, would long
since have plunged me into misery; but there
seems to be a mighty exertion of mercy and grace
upon my sinful nature, every day, to keep me from
perishing at last. My attainments in the divine
life, in this last year, seem to be none at all; I
appear, on the contrary, to be more self-willed
and perverse; and more like many of my countrymen,
in arrogance and a domineering spirit over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the natives. The Lord save me from my wickedness!
Henceforth let my soul, humbly depending
upon the grace of Christ, perfect holiness in the
fear of God, and show towards all, whether Europeans
or natives, the mind that was in Christ
Jesus.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn had two assistants in his Indian and
Persian translations, one named Mirza, of Hindoostan,
the other Sabat, an Arabian. The latter of
these, for some time, professed to be a convert to
Christianity, but afterwards returned to Mohammedism.
Sabat’s temper and behaviour were so
inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel, that he
gave Mr. Martyn great uneasiness; but his expressions
of a desire to reform seemed so sincere, that
he was long regarded as a genuine Christian, whom,
it was hoped, more light, and knowledge, and
grace, would gradually lead aright.</p>

<p>In March, 1808, Martyn completed the New
Testament in Hindoostanee, and sent it to Calcutta
to be printed. The correcting of the sheets as
they came from the press, occupied much of his
time: besides which, he superintended and compared
the Persian translation by Sabat, and studied
the Arabic, that he might have a translation made
into that language also. He received visits daily,
from such of his congregation as were serious, and
visited the hospital as usual. In consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
the want of a proper place for public worship at
Dinapore, he held meetings at his own house. On
the first Sunday, he preached from Isaiah iv. 5
“The Lord will create upon every dwelling-place
of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a
cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a
flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall
be a defence.” “In the afternoon,” his diary relates,
“I waited for the women, but not one came:
perhaps, by some mistake, notice had not been given
them. At the hospital, and with the men at night,
I was engaged, as usual, in prayer: my soul panted
after the living God, but it remained tied and bound
with corruption. I felt as if I could have given
the world to be brought to be alone with God; and
the promise that ‘this is the will of God, even our
sanctification,’—was the right hand that upheld me
while I followed after Him. When low in spirits,
through an unwillingness to take up the cross, I
found myself more resigned in endeavouring to
realise the thought which had often composed me
in my trials on board the ship; namely, that I was
born to suffer; that suffering is my appointed daily
portion; let this reconcile me to every thing! To
have a will of my own, not agreeable to God’s, is
a most tremendous wickedness. I own it is so,
for a few moments: but, Lord, write it on my
heart! In perfect meekness and resignation let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
me take whatever befalls me in the path of duty,
and never dare to think of being dissatisfied.”</p>

<p>In June, the gospel of Matthew was finished in
Persian, and sent to Calcutta, where it was printed
at the expense of the British and Foreign Bible
Society. In the summer he suffered a severe
attack of illness, his reflections on which show
the spirituality of his feelings, and the joyfulness
of his prospects of eternity.</p>

<p>“I little thought to have had my faith brought
to a trial so soon. This morning, while getting up
I found a pain in the centre of my body, which increased
to such a degree, that fever and vertigo
came on, and I fainted. The dreadful sensation
was like what I once felt in England, but by no
means so violent or long-continued; as then, also,
I was alone. After recovering my senses, and lying
in pain which almost made me breathless, I turned
my thoughts to God; and oh! praise to his grace
and love, I felt no fear; but I prayed earnestly
that I might have a little relief to set my house in
order, and make my will. I also thought with
pain, of leaving the Persian gospels unfinished. By
means of some ether, the Lord gave me ease, and
I made my will. The day was spent in great weakness,
but my heart was often filled with the sweetest
peace and gratitude for the precious things God
hath done for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“I found delight at night in considering, from
the beginning, all that God had done in creation,
providence, and grace, for my soul. O God of
love, how shall I praise Thee!—happiness, bliss
for ever, lies before me. Thou hast brought me
upon this stage of life to see what sin and misery
are; myself, alas! most deeply partaking in both.
But the days and the works of my former state,
fraught with danger and with death, are no more;
and the God of benevolence and love hath opened
to me brighter prospects. Thine I am; ‘My
beloved is mine, and I am his;’ and now I want
none but Thee. I am alone with Thee in this
world; and when I put off this mortal tabernacle,
I shall still be with Thee, whatever that unknown
change may be; and I shall be before Thee, not to
receive honour, but to ascribe praise. Yes! I shall
then have power to express my feelings; I shall
then, without intermission, see and love; and no
cloud of sorrow overcast my mind. I shall then
sing in worthy, everlasting strains, the praises of
that divine Redeemer, whose works of love now
reach beyond my conception.”</p>

<p>Some portions of his letters to the Rev. Messrs.
Corrie and Brown, at Calcutta, during this year,
and part of 1809, will show his labours, trials, and
consolations, in a better manner than our narrative
could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“I do not know how you find the heat, but here
it is dreadful: in one person’s quarters yesterday
it was at 102°: perhaps it was on that account that
scarcely any women came. Another reason I
assign is, that I rebuked one of them last Sunday,
yet very gently, for talking and laughing in the
church before I came; so yesterday they showed
their displeasure by not coming at all. I spoke to
them on the parable of the Great Supper: the old
woman, who is always so exemplary in her attention,
shed many tears; I have sometimes endeavoured
to speak to her, but she declines conversation.
I feel interested about her, there is so much
sorrow and meekness depicted in her countenance;
but she always crosses herself after the service is
over. My Europeans, this week, have not attended
very well; fifteen only, instead of twenty-five;
some of them, indeed, are in the hospital; and the
hospital is a town of itself;—how shall I ever be
faithful to them all!”</p>

<p>“Among the events of the last week is the earthquake;
we were just reading the passage of the
24th of Matthew, on ‘earthquakes in divers places,’
when I felt my chair shake under me; then some
pieces of the plaster fell; on which I sprang up
and ran out;—the doors had still a tremulous
motion.”</p>

<p>“I groan at the wickedness and infidelity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
men, and seem to stretch my neck every way to
espy a righteous man. All at Dinapore treat the
gospel with contempt; here there is nothing but
infidelity.”</p>

<p>“A young civilian, who some time ago came to
me desiring satisfaction on the evidences of Christianity,
and to whom I spoke very freely, and with
some regard, as I could not doubt his sincerity, now
holds me up to ridicule. Thus, through evil report,
we go on. Oh! my brother! how happy I feel,
that all have not forsaken Christ; that I am not
left alone even in India. ‘Cast thy burden on the
Lord, and he shall sustain thee,’ is the text I carry
about with me, and I can recommend it to any
body as an infallible preservative from the fever of
anxiety.”</p>

<p>“The day after I wrote to you from Bankipore,
I called on the Nawaub,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Babir Ali Khan, celebrated
for his sense and liberality. I staid two
hours with him, conversing in Persian, but badly.
He began the theological discussion by requesting
me to explain necessity and free-will; I instantly
pleaded ignorance. He gave his own opinion; on
which I asked him for his proofs of the religion of
Mohammed. His first argument was the eloquence
of the Koran; but he at last acknowledged that this
was insufficient. I then brought forward a passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
or two in the Koran, containing sentiments manifestly
false and foolish; he flourished a good deal,
but concluded by saying, that I must wait till I
could speak Persian better, and had read their logic.
This was the first visit, and I returned highly delighted
with his sense, candour, and politeness.
Two days after I went to breakfast with him, and
conversed with him in Hindoostanee. He inquired
what are the principles of the Christian religion; I
began with the atonement, the divinity of Christ,
the corruption of human nature, the necessity of
regeneration, and a holy life. He seems to wish
to acquire information, but discovers no spiritual
desire after the truth.”</p>

<p>“I mentioned to you that I had spoken very
plainly to the women last Sunday, on the delusions
of the papists: yesterday only seven came. I ascribed
it to what I had said; but to-day Sabat tells
me that they pour contempt upon it all. Sabat,
instead of comforting and encouraging me in my
disappointments and trials, aggravates my pain by
contemptuous expressions of the perfect inutility
of continuing to teach them. He may spare his
sarcastic remarks; as I suppose, after another Sunday,
none at all will come. I find no relief but in
prayer: to God I can tell all my griefs, and find
comfort.”</p>

<p>“One day this week, on getting up in the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
I was attacked with a very serious illness. I
thought I was leaving this world of sorrow; and,
praised be the God of grace, I felt no fear. The
rest of the day I was filled with sweet peace of mind,
and had near access to God in prayer. What a
debt of love and praise do we owe! Yesterday I
attempted to examine the women who attended (in
number about thirty,) in Christian knowledge; they
were very shy, and said that they could say no
prayers but in Portuguese. It appears that they
were highly incensed, and went away, saying to
Joseph, ‘We know a great deal more than your
priest himself.’ The services much weakened me
after my late attack.”</p>

<p>“The men are fast dying in the hospital, yet
they would rather be sent to Patna for some holy
oil, than hear the word of eternal life. Two or
three of my evening hearers are in the hospital;
one is prepared to die: blessed sight! The Persian
of St. Mark is to be sent to-morrow, and five
chapters of Luke, corrected. There is no news
from down the stream; but always glad tidings for
us from the world above.”</p>

<p>The following is from a letter to his sister, in
England:</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I have not good accounts to
give of my health; yet no danger is to be apprehended.
My services on the Lord’s day always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
leave me a pain in the chest, and such a great degree
of general relaxation, that I seldom recover from it
till Tuesday. A few days ago I was attacked with
a fever, which, by the mercy of God, lasted but two
days. I am now well, but must be more careful
for the future. In this debilitating climate, the
mortal tabernacle is frail indeed: my mind seems
as vigorous as ever, but my delicate frame soon
calls for relaxation; and I must give it, though
unwillingly; for such glorious fields for exertion
open all around, that I could with pleasure be
employed from morning to night. It seems a
providential circumstance, that the work at present
assigned me is that of translation; for had I gone
through the villages, preaching, as my intention led
me to do, I fear that by this time I should have
been in a deep decline. In my last I gave you a
general idea of my employments. The society
still meet every night at my quarters, and though
we have lost many by death, others are raised up
in their room; one officer, a lieutenant, is also given
to me; and he is not only a brother beloved, but
a constant companion and nurse; so you must feel
no apprehension that I should be left alone in sickness;
neither on any other account should you be
uneasy. You know that we must meet no more
in this life: therefore, since we are, as I trust, both
children of God by faith in Jesus Christ, it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
a matter of less consequence when we leave this
earth. Of the spread of the gospel in India, I can
say little, because I hear nothing. Adieu, my
dearest sister: let us live in constant prayer, for
ourselves, and for the church.”</p>

<p>The annexed extracts are from his correspondence
with Messrs. Corrie and Brown:</p>

<p>“I have just come out of my chapel, where,
with my little flock, I have once more resumed my
duties. The infrequency of my appearance among
them of late has thinned them considerably; and
this effect, which I foresaw, is one of the most
painful and lamentable consequences of my withdrawing
from them; but it is unavoidable, if I
wish to prolong my life. My danger is from the
lungs: though none of you seem to apprehend
it. One complete service at church does more to
consume my strength and spirits than six days
of the hardest study, or bodily labour. Pray for
me, my dear brother, that I may neither be rash
nor indolent.”</p>

<p>“You mention a letter enclosed, but none came.
The intelligence, however, intended to be conveyed
by it, met my delighted eyes. Thomason is coming!
This is good. Praise be to the Lord of the
harvest, for sending out labourers! Behold how
the prayers of the society at Calcutta have been
heard. I hope they will continue their supplication;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
for we want more yet, and it may please God
yet further to bless us. You cannot leave Calcutta
by the middle of November, and must therefore
apply for one month’s extension of leave. But
you are unwilling to leave your flock; and I do not
wonder, as I have seen my sheep grievously dispersed
during my absence. Uncertain when I may
come amongst them, they seldom come at all, except
the ten or twelve who meet one another. My
morning congregation increases as the cold weather
advances, and yesterday there seemed to be a considerable
impression. I spoke in a low tone of
voice, and therefore, did not feel much fatigue;—after
the Hindoostanee service I was very weak;
but at night tolerably strong again. On the whole,
my expectations of life return. May the days thus
prolonged be entirely His who continues them! and
may my work not only move on delightfully, but
with a more devout and serious spirit!”</p>

<p>“Your letter from Buxar found me in much the
same spiritual state, as you describe yourself to be
in: though your description, no doubt, belongs
more properly to me. I no longer hesitate to
ascribe my stupor and formality, to its right cause:
unwatchfulness in worldly company. I thought
that any temptation arising from the society of the
people of the world, at least of such as we have
had, was not worthy of notice: but I find myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
mistaken. The frequent occasions of being among
them of late, have proved a snare to my corrupt
heart. Instead of returning with a more elastic
spring to severe duties, as I expected, my heart
wants more idleness, more dissipation. David
Brainerd in the wilderness,—what a contrast to
Henry Martyn! But God be thanked that a start
now and then interrupts the slumber. I hope to be
up and about my Master’s business; to cast off the
works of darkness, and to be spiritually-minded,
which alone is life and peace. But what a dangerous
country it is that we are in; hot weather or
cold, all is softness and luxury; all a conspiracy to
lull us to sleep in the lap of pleasure. While we
pass over this enchanted ground, call, brother, ever
and anon, and ask ‘is all well?’ We are shepherds
keeping watch over our flocks by night: if we fall
asleep what is to become of them!”</p>

<p>“Last Friday we had the happiness and honour
of finishing the four gospels in Persian. The same
evening I made some discovery respecting the
Hebrew verb, but was unfortunately so much delighted,
that I could not sleep; in consequence of
which, I have had a head-ache ever since. Thus
even intellectual joys are followed by sorrow: not
so spiritual ones. I pray continually that <em>order</em>
may be preserved in my heart; that I may esteem
and delight most in that work, which is really most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
estimable and delightful, the work of Christ and
his apostles. When this is in any measure the
case, it is surprising how clear and orderly the
thoughts are on other subjects. I am still a good
deal in the dark respecting the objects of my pursuit;
but have so far an insight, that I read both
Hebrew and Arabic with increasing pleasure and
satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely know how this week has passed,
nor can I call to mind the circumstances of one
single day; so absorbed have I been in my new
pursuit. I remember, however, that during one
night I did not sleep a wink. Knowing what
would be the consequence the next day, I struggled
hard, and turned every way, that my mind might
be diverted from what was before it;—but all in
vain. One discovery succeeded another, in Hebrew,
Arabic, and Greek, so rapidly, that I was sometimes
in almost ecstasy; but after all, I have moved
but a step: you may scold me if you please, but I
am helpless. I do not turn to this study of myself,
but it turns to me, and draws me away almost irresistibly.
Still I perceive it to be a mark of a fallen
nature to be so carried away by a pleasure merely
intellectual; and, therefore, while I pray for the
gifts of his Spirit, I feel the necessity of being still
more earnest for His grace. ‘Whether there be
tongues they shall cease; whether there be knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
it shall vanish away; but charity never
faileth.’ Yesterday my mind was mercifully kept
free the whole day: and I ministered without distraction,
and moreover without fatigue. I do not
know when I have found myself so strong. The
state of the air affects me more than any thing else.
On Saturday, I completed my twenty-eighth year.
Shall I live to see another birth-day?—it will be
better to suppose not. I have not read Faber yet;
but it seems evident to me that the XIth of Daniel,
almost the whole of it, refers to future time. But
as the time of accomplishing the scriptures draws
on, knowledge shall increase. In solemn expectation
we must wait, to see how our God will come.
How interesting are his doings! We feel already
some of that rapture wherewith they sing above,
‘Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God
Almighty! just and true are thy ways, thou king
of saints!’”</p>

<p>“I did not write to you last week, because I was
employed night and day, on Monday and Tuesday,
with Sabat, in correcting some sheets for the press.
I begin my letter, now, immediately on receiving
yours of last week. The account of your complaint,
as you may suppose, grieves me exceedingly;
not because I think that I shall outlive you,
but because your useful labours must be reduced to
one quarter of their present amount; and that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
may perhaps be obliged to take a voyage to Europe,
which involves loss of time and money. But, O
brother beloved! what is life or death? Nothing,
to the believer in Jesus. ‘He that believeth,
though he were dead, yet shall he live; and he
that liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die.
The first and most natural effect of sickness, as I
have often found, is to cloud and terrify the mind.
The attention of the soul is arrested by the idea of
soon appearing in a new world; and a sense of
guilt is felt, before faith is exercised in a Redeemer:
and for a time this will predominate; for the same
faith that would overcome fear in health, must be
considerably strengthened to have the same ascendency
in sickness. I trust you will long live to do
the work of your Lord Jesus. My discoveries are
all at an end. I am just where I was; in perfect
darkness, and tired of the pursuit. It is, however,
likely that I shall be constantly speculating on the
subject. My thirst after knowledge is very strong;
but I pray continually that the Spirit of God may
hold the reins; that I may mind the work of God
above all things; and consider all things else as
merely occasional.”</p>

<p>The preceding extracts show the progress of
Martyn and Sabat in their translations, the debility
of Martyn’s health, and the new temptations of
study which were presented to his mind. In March<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
1809, a large place of worship was opened, but he
was not permitted to enjoy many services in it, as
he was sent by the East India Company to be
chaplain at Cawnpore, almost four hundred miles
from Dinapore, and seven hundred from Calcutta.
This journey he performed at the hottest season of
the year; for two days and nights he travelled
without stopping, during which time the wind
seemed to him like flames, and he lay in his palanquin
almost insensible. A lady of Cawnpore,
speaks as follows of his tour:</p>

<p>“The month of April, in the upper provinces of
Hindoostan, is one of the most dreadful months for
travelling throughout the year; indeed, no European,
at that time, can remove from place to place,
but at the hazard of his life. But Mr. Martyn had
that anxiety to be in the work which his heavenly
father had given him to do, that, notwithstanding
the violent heat, he travelled from Chunar to Cawnpore,
the space of about four hundred miles. At
that time, as I well remember, the air was as hot and
dry as that which I have sometimes felt near the
mouth of a large oven;—no friendly cloud, or verdant
carpet of grass, to relieve the eye from the
strong glare of the rays of the sun, pouring on the
sandy plains of the Ganges. Thus Mr. Martyn
travelled, journeying night and day, and arrived at
Cawnpore in such a state, that he fainted away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
as soon as he entered the house. When we charged
him with the rashness of hazarding his life in
this manner, he always pleaded his anxiety to get
to the great work. He remained with us ten days,
suffering considerably at times from fever and pain
in the chest.”</p>

<p>At Cawnpore there was no church, or regular
worship. Soon after his arrival, Martyn preached
to the soldiers in the open air, when, such was the
heat, although before sunrise, that many dropped
down as they stood around him in ranks. He
adopted the same course of public services as at
Dinapore, and continued to superintend the Arabic
and a new Persian translation of the New Testament,
as the first one was found too imperfect for
publication. These duties occupied his whole time,
excepting when his duties occasionally required
him to take journeys to distant towns.</p>

<p>Having received intelligence of the fatal illness
of his only sister, the last tie to earthly objects
seems to have been broken. “What is there now,”
he exclaimed, “that I should wish to live for? O
what a barren desert, what a howling wilderness,
does this world appear! But for the service of
God and his church, and the preparation of my
own soul, I do not know that I would wish to live
another day.” It was this sister who first attempted
to draw his attention to religion: and how must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
he now have looked back upon the day, when, as
he confessed, the sound of the gospel from her lips
was grating to his ear!</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn had been accustomed to give alms
to a number of the poor natives; and to avoid the
frequent interruption of his studies, which their
calls occasioned, he fixed a time for them to come
to his door. As a great number of wretched beings
was thus collected, he determined to embrace
the opportunity of attempting to preach to them.
Of his first address to them he has left this account:</p>

<p>“I told them, after requesting their attention,
that I gave with pleasure the alms I could afford,
but wished to give them something better, namely,
eternal riches, or the knowledge of God, which
was to be had from God’s word; and then producing
a Hindoostanee translation of Genesis, read the
first verse, and explained it word by word. In the
beginning, when there was nothing, no heaven, no
earth, but only God, he created without help, for
his own pleasure.—But who is God? One so
great, so good, so wise, so mighty, that none can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
know him as he ought to know: but yet we must
know that he knows us. When we rise up, or sit
down, or go out, he is always with us.—He created
heaven and earth; therefore every thing in heaven—sun,
moon, and stars. Therefore how should
the sun be God, or the moon be God? He created
every thing on earth; therefore Ganges also: therefore
how should Ganges be God? Neither are they
like God. If a shoemaker make a pair of shoes, are
the shoes like him? If a man make an image, the
image is not like man, his maker. Infer secondly,
if God made the heavens and the earth for you,
and made the meat also for you, will he not also
feed you? Know also, that he that made heaven
and earth can destroy them;—and will do it; therefore
fear God, who is so great; and love God, who
is so good.”</p>

<p>“I bless God,” said Mr. Martyn, “for helping
me, beyond my expectation. Yet still my corrupt
heart looks forward to the next attempt with some
dread.”</p>

<p>On the Sunday after this, he preached to at least
five hundred of this class.</p>

<p>“I did not,” he remarks, “succeed so well as
before; I suppose because I had more confidence
in myself, and less in the Lord. I fear they did
not understand me well; but the few sentences
that were clear, they applauded. Speaking to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of the sea and rivers, I spoke to them again of the
Ganges, that it was no more than other rivers.
God loved the Hindoos,—but he loved other people
too; and whatever river, or water, or other
good thing he gave the Hindoos, he gave other
people also: for all are alike before God. Ganges
therefore, is not to be worshipped; because, so far
from being a God, it is not better than other rivers.
In speaking of the earth and moon, ‘as a candle in
the house, so is the sun,’ I said, ‘in the heavens.’
But would I worship a candle in my hand? These
were nice points; I felt as if treading on tender
ground, and was almost disposed to blame myself
for imprudence. I thought, that amidst the silence
these remarks produced, I heard hisses and groans:
but a few Mohammedans applauded.”</p>

<p>The number of persons on these occasions, sometimes
amounted to eight hundred, composed of Mohammedans
and Pagans. And though it was natural
for them to be very respectful and attentive,
in the supposition that their ill behaviour might
cause Martyn to refuse them charity, yet it was
evident that many were really interested in the new
doctrines he taught them. They sometimes made
sensible remarks in assent to what he declared; or
kept entire silence, as if deeply thinking on it.
They were very much moved, at one time, when,
after detailing the history of God’s judgment on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Sodom, the preacher suddenly applied the subject
to themselves—</p>

<p>“Do you too,” he said, “repent of your sins,
and turn to God. For though you are not like
the men of Sodom,—God forbid!—you are nevertheless
sinners. Are there no thieves, railers,
extortioners, among you? Be you sure that God
is angry. I say not that he will burn your town,
but that he will burn you. Haste, therefore, out
of Sodom. Sodom is the world, which is full
of sinners and sin. Come out, therefore, from
amongst them; forsake not your worldly business,
but your sinful companions. Do not be like the
world, lest you perish with them. Do not, like
Lot, linger; say not, to-morrow we will repent,
lest you never see to-morrow; repent to-day.
Then, as Lot, seated on the hill, beheld the flames
in safety, you also, sitting on the hills of heaven,
shall behold the ruins of the world without fear.”</p>

<p>But his health beginning to suffer, from his labours
and the heat of the climate, he was, with
great reluctance, compelled to give up this portion
of his services. He wrote to his friend, Mr.
Simeon, “I read your letter, of 6th of July, 1809,
cautioning me against over-exertion, with the confidence
of one who had nothing to fear. This was
only three weeks ago. Since the last Lord’s day,
your kind advice was brought home to my mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
accompanied with painful regret that I had not paid
more attention to it. My work last Sunday was
not more than usual, but far too much for me, I can
perceive. First, service to his Majesty’s fifty-third
regiment, in the open air; then at head-quarters;
in the afternoon, preached to eight hundred natives;
at night, to my little flock of Europeans. Which
of these can I forego? The ministration of the
natives might be in the week: but I wish to attach
the idea of holiness to the Sunday. My evening
congregation, on Sunday, is attended by twice as
many as in the week-day; so how can I let this
go?”</p>

<p>He was assisted for some time by Mr. Corrie,
from Calcutta, and once more attempted to address
the beggars; but his weakness, and other symptoms
of declining health, increased so much, that it
became necessary for him to leave Cawnpore. At
first, he determined to visit England for a short
time, thinking that he could there best renew his
strength; but he afterwards concluded to visit Persia
and Arabia, that he might collect the opinions
of the learned natives, respecting the accuracy of
the translation of the New Testament into those
tongues, the first of which was supposed to be
written in a style not likely to be understood by
the common people, and therefore not yet published,
and the last being still unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>On the first of October, 1810, he left Cawnpore
for this purpose, thus connecting the pursuit of
health with his great missionary enterprise. As
at Dinapore, he left this station just as a new
church was completed, in which he had the happiness
of preaching the first sermon, the day before
his departure. On his voyage down the
Ganges to Aldeen, he visited the part of the army
he had before served; but most of those of whom
he had cherished the strongest hopes, had neglected
his warnings, and were ashamed to see him.
Nine only came to his boat, where he sang, prayed
with, and exhorted them. At Aldeen and Calcutta,
he enjoyed the society of his dear friends,
the missionaries, and preached frequently, though
exceedingly weak. One of his sermons was an appeal
to the Europeans, on behalf of the nine hundred
thousand natives of India, who possessed
Christianity in some form, but were destitute of the
Scriptures; “many of them,” as he said, “relapsing
fast to idolatry, and already, indeed, little better
than heathens.”</p>

<p>“Mention not their meanness; it is yours to
raise them from degradation. Despise not their
inferiority, nor reproach them for their errors; they
cannot get a Bible to read. Had they been blessed
with your advantages, they would have been, perhaps,
more worthy of your respect. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
said with too much truth, that they scarcely deserve
the name of Christians. How is it possible that it
should be otherwise, without the Bible, when it is
considered how little oral instruction they receive.”
The sermon concluded with this address:</p>

<p>“Imagine the sad situation of a sick or dying
Christian, who has just heard enough of eternity
to be afraid of death, and not enough of a Saviour
to look beyond it with hope. He cannot call for a
Bible to look for something to support him, or ask
his wife or child to read him a consolatory chapter.
The Bible, alas! is a treasure which they never
had the happiness to possess. O pity their distress,
you that have hearts to feel for the miseries of your
fellow creatures; you that have discernment to see,
that a wounded spirit is far more agonizing than any
earth-begotten woes; you that know that you too
must one day die, O give unto him what may comfort
him in a dying hour. The Lord, who loves
our brethren, who gave his life for them and for
you, who gave you the Bible before them, and now
wills that they should receive it from you, he will
reward you. They cannot recompense you, but
you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the
just. The King himself will say to you, ‘inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</p>

<p>This sermon was printed in Calcutta, and contributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
essentially to the institution of the Calcutta
Bible Society, and the liberal support it received.</p>

<p>His last discourse was in January 1811, from
the words of our Saviour, “One thing is needful;”
after which he left India, never more to return,
though hoping to recover his health and spend the
remainder of his life there.</p>

<p>“I now pass,” he wrote, “from India to Arabia,
not knowing the things that shall befall me
there, but assured that an ever-faithful God and Saviour
will be with me in all places, whithersoever
I go. May he guide me and protect me, and after
prospering me in the thing whereunto I go, bring
me back again to my delightful work in India. I
am perhaps leaving it to see it no more; but the
will of God be done; my times are in his hand,
and he will cut them as short as shall be most for
my good: and with this assurance, I feel that nothing
need interrupt my work or my peace.”</p>

<p>His passage from the mouth of the river Hoogley,
on which Calcutta is situated, to Shiraz, the capital
of Persia, occupied five months. The particulars,
which are worthy of notice, are given in his
own words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

“<em>Bay of Bengal, January, 1811.</em><br>

<p>“I took a passage in the ship Ahmoody, Captain
Kinsay, bound to Bombay. One of my fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
passengers was the Honourable Mr. Elphinstone
who was proceeding to take the Residency of
Poonah. His agreeable manners and classical acquirements,
made me think myself fortunate indeed,
in having such a companion, and I found his
company the most agreeable circumstance in my
voyage.</p>

<p>“Our captain was a pupil of Swartz,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of whom
he communicated many interesting particulars.—Swartz,
with Kolhoff and Jœnicke, kept a school
for half-caste children, about a mile and a half from
Tanjore; but went every night to the Tanjore
church, to meet about sixty or seventy of the king’s
regiment, who assembled for devotional purposes:
after which he officiated to their wives and children
in Portuguese. At the school, Swartz used to read,
in the morning, out of the German ‘Meditation for
every day in the year;’ at night, he had family
prayer. Jœnicke taught geography; Kolhoff, writing
and arithmetic. They had also masters in
Persian and Malabar.</p>

<p>“At the time when the present Rajah was in
danger of his life, from the usurper of his uncle’s
throne, Swartz used to sleep in the same room
with him. This was sufficient protection, ‘for
(said the captain,) Swartz was considered by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
natives as something more than mortal.’ The old
Rajah, at his death, committed his nephew to
Swartz.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 27th</em> to 31.—Generally unwell. In prayer,
my views of my Saviour have been inexpressibly
consolatory. How glorious the privilege that we
exist but in him; without him I lose the principle
of life, and am left to the power of native corruption,—a
rotten branch, a dead thing, that none can
make use of. This mass of corruption, when it
meets the Lord, changes its nature, and lives
throughout, and is regarded by God as a member
of Christ’s body. This is my bliss, that Christ is
all. Upheld by him, I smile at death. It is no
longer a question about my own worthiness. I
glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“<em>Feb. 18th.</em>—Anchored at Bombay.—This day
I finished the thirtieth year of my unprofitable life;
the age at which David Brainerd finished his
course. I am now at the age at which the Saviour
of men began his ministry, and at which John the
Baptist called a nation to repentance. Let me now
think for myself, and act with energy. Hitherto
I have made my youth and insignificance an excuse
for sloth and imbecility: now let me have a character,
and act boldly for God.”</p>

<p>“<em>March 25th.</em>—Embarked on board the Benares,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Captain Sealy; who, in company with the
Prince of Wales, Captain Hepburn, was ordered to
cruise in the Persian Gulf, against the Arab pirates.
We got under way immediately, and were outside
the land before night.”</p>

<p>“<em>March 31.</em>—The European part of the ship’s
crew, consisting of forty-five sailors and twelve artillerymen,
were assembled on the quarter-deck to
hear divine service. I wondered to see so many
of the seamen inattentive; but I afterwards found
that most of them were foreigners, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, &amp;c. We had prayers in the cabin
every night. In the afternoon I used to read to a
sick man below, and two or three others would
come to hear.”</p>

<p>“<em>April 21.</em>—Anchored at Muscat, in Arabia</p>

<p>“<em>May 22.</em>—Landed at Bushire.”</p>

<p>“On 30th of May, our Persian dresses were
ready, and we set out for Shiraz. The Persian dress
consists of, first, stockings and shoes in one; next,
a pair of large blue trowsers, or else a pair of huge
red boots; then the shirt, then the tunic, and above
it the coat, both of chintz, and a great coat. I have
here described my own dress, most of which I
have on at this moment. On the head is worn an
enormous cone, made of the skin of the black Tar
tar sheep, with the wool on. If to this description
of my dress, I add, that my beard and mustachios<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
have been suffered to grow undisturbed ever since
I left India, that I am sitting on a Persian carpet,
in a room without tables or chairs, and that I bury
my hand in the dish, without waiting for spoon or
plate, you will give me credit for being already an
accomplished oriental.”</p>

<p>“At sunrise we came to our ground at Ahmedee,
and pitched our little tent under a tree; it was the
only shelter we could get. At first the heat was
not greater than we had felt in India, but it soon
became so intense as to be quite alarming. When
the thermometer was above 112°, fever heat, I began
to lose my strength fast; at last, it became
quite intolerable. I wrapped myself up in a blanket,
and all the warm covering I could get, to defend
myself from the external air; by which means the
moisture was kept a little longer upon the body, and
not so speedily evaporated as when the skin was
exposed: one of my companions followed my example,
and found the benefit of it. But the thermometer
still rising, and the moisture of the body
being quite exhausted, I grew restless, and thought
I should have lost my senses. The thermometer
at last stood at 126°; in this state I composed myself,
and concluded that though I might hold out a
day or two, death was inevitable. Captain ——,
who sat it out, continued to tell the hour and height
of the thermometer: and with what pleasure did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
we hear of its sinking to 120°, 118°, &amp;c. At last
the fierce sun retired, and I crept out, more dead
than alive. It was then a difficulty how I could
proceed on my journey; for besides the immediate
effects of the heat, I had no opportunity of making
up for the last night’s want of sleep, and had eaten
nothing. However, while they were loading the
mules I got an hour’s sleep, and set out, the muleteer
leading my horse, and Zachariah, my servant,
an Armenian, of Isfahan, doing all in his power to
encourage me. The cool air of the night restored
me wonderfully, so that I arrived at our next stopping
place, with no other derangement than that
occasioned by want of sleep. Expecting another
such day as the former, we began to make preparation
the instant we arrived on the ground. I got a
shelter made of the branches of the date tree, and
a Persian peasant to water it; by this means the
thermometer did not rise higher than 114°. But
what completely secured me from the heat, was a
large wet towel, which I wrapped round my head
and body, muffling up the lower part in clothes.
How could I but be grateful to a gracious Providence,
for giving me so simple a defence against
what, I am persuaded, would have destroyed my
life that day. We took care not to go without
nourishment, as we had done; the neighbouring
village supplied us with curds and milk. At sunset,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
rising up to go out, a scorpion fell upon my clothes;
not seeing where it fell, I did not know what it
was; but Captain —— pointing it out, gave the
alarm, and I struck it off, and he killed it. The
night before, we found a black scorpion in our tent;
this made us rather uneasy; so that, although we
did not start till midnight, we got no sleep, fearing
we might be visited by another scorpion.</p>

<p>“The next morning we arrived at the foot of the
mountains. A strong suffocating smell of naphtha,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
announced something more than ordinarily foul in
the neighbourhood. We saw a river; what flowed
in it, it seemed difficult to say, whether it was water,
or green oil; it scarcely moved, and the stones
which it laved, it left of a greyish colour, as if its
foul touch had given them the leprosy. Our place
of encampment this day was a grove of date trees.
I threw myself down on the burning ground, and
slept: when the tent came up, I awoke, as usual,
in a burning fever. All this day, I had recourse to
a wet towel, which kept me alive, but would allow
of no sleep. It was a sorrowful sabbath; but Captain
—— read a few hymns, in which I found great
consolation. At nine in the evening we decamped.
The ground and air were so insufferably hot, that
I could not travel without a wet towel round my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
face and neck. This night, for the first time, we
began to ascend the mountains. The road often
passed so close to the edge of the tremendous precipices,
that one false step of the horse would have
plunged his rider into inevitable destruction. In
such circumstances, I found it useless to attempt
guiding the animal, and therefore gave him the rein.
These poor animals are so used to journeys of this
sort, that they generally step sure. There was
nothing to mark the road, but the rocks being a
little more worn in one place than in another.
Sometimes my horse, which led the way, as being
the muleteer’s, stopped, as if to consider about the
way: for myself, I could not guess, at such times,
where the road lay; but he always found it. The
sublime scenery would have impressed me much,
in other circumstances: but my sleepiness and fatigue
rendered me insensible to every thing around
me. At last we emerged, not on the top of a mountain,
to go down again,—but to a plain, or upper
world.”</p>

<p>“We rode briskly over the plain, breathing a
purer air, and soon came in sight of a fair edifice,
built by the king of the country for the refreshment
of pilgrims. In this caravansera we took up our
abode for the day. It was more calculated for
eastern, than European travellers, having no means
of keeping out the air and light. We found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
thermometer at 110°. At the passes we met a man
travelling down to Bushire, with a load of ice,
which he willingly disposed of to us. The next
night we ascended another range of mountains,
and passed over a plain, where the cold was so
piercing, that with all the clothes we could muster,
we were shivering. At the end of this plain, we
entered a dark valley, contained by two ranges of
hills, approaching one another. The muleteer gave
notice that he saw robbers. It proved to be a false
alarm; but the place was fitted to be a retreat for
robbers; there being on each side caves and fastnesses
from which they might have killed every
man of us. After ascending another mountain, we
descended by a very long and circuitous route into
an extensive valley, where we were exposed to the
sun till eight o’clock. Whether from the sun, or
from continued want of sleep, I could not, on my
arrival at Carzeroon, compose myself to sleep;
there seemed to be a fire within my head, my skin
like a cinder, and the pulse violent. Through the
day it was again too hot to sleep, though the place
we occupied was a sort of summer-house, in a garden
of cypress-trees, exceedingly well fitted up
with mats and coloured glass. Had the caravan
gone on that night, I could not have accompanied
it; but it halted here a day, by which means I got
a sort of night’s rest, though I woke twenty times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
to dip my burning hands in water. Though Carzeroon
is the second greatest town in Fars, we
could get nothing but bread, milk, and eggs, and
those with difficulty.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 7th.</em>—The hours we were permitted to
rest, the musquitoes had effectually prevented me
from using; so that I never felt more miserable
and disordered; the cold was very severe; for fear
of falling off, from sleep and numbness, I walked a
good part of the way. We pitched our tent in the
vale of Dustarjan, near a crystal stream; the
whole valley was one green field, in which large
herds of cattle were browsing. The temperature
was about that of spring in England. Here a few
hours sleep recovered me, in some degree, from
the stupidity in which I had been for some days.
I awoke with a light heart, and said, ‘He knoweth
our frame, and remembereth we are dust. He redeemeth
our life from destruction, and crowneth
us with loving kindness and tender mercies. He
maketh us to lie down on the green pastures, and
leadeth us beside the still waters. And when we
have left this vale of tears, there is no more sorrow,
nor sighing, nor any more pain. The sun shall
not light upon thee, nor any heat; but the Lamb
shall lead thee to living fountains of waters.’</p>

<p>“<em>June 8th.</em>—Went on to a caravansera, where
we passed the day. At night set out upon our last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
march for Shiraz. Sleepiness, my old companion
and enemy, again overtook me. I was in perpetual
danger of falling off my horse, till at last I pushed
on to a considerable distance, planted my back
against a wall, and slept, I know not how long, till
the good muleteer came up, and gently waked me.”</p>

<p>He arrived the next morning at Shiraz, the capital
of the Persian empire. His first object was to
ascertain from those best skilled in the language,
how well Sabat’s Persian translation would be understood
by the people. Finding that their opinion
was against it, he, in a little more than a week after
his arrival, undertook the task anew, with the
assistance of Mirza Seid Ali Khan, who belonged
to the sect called Soofees. Whilst engaged in this
work, he was visited constantly by learned Persians,
who argued with him respecting the Christian
religion and Mohammedism. But their prejudices
in favour of their sensual creed were too strong to
yield to mere arguments. Some of them were Jews
who had become Mussulmans; a very frequent
change, as every such convert is rewarded with a
new dress, by the prince.—The condition of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
wandering descendants of Abraham, greatly excited
his sympathy. On one occasion “while walking
in the garden, in some disorder from vexation, two
Mussulman Jews came up, and asked me what
would become of them in another world? the Mohammedans
were right in their way, they supposed,
and we in ours; but what must they expect? After
rectifying their mistake as to the Mohammedans, I
mentioned two or three reasons for believing that
we are right: such as their dispersion, and the cessation
of sacrifices, immediately on the appearance
of Jesus. ‘True, true,’ they said, with great feeling
and seriousness; indeed, they seemed disposed to
yield assent to any thing I said. They confessed
they had become Mohammedans only on compulsion;
and that Abdoolghunee wished to go to Bagdad,
thinking he might throw off the mask there with
safety;—but asked, what I thought? I said that
the governor was a Mohammedan. ‘Did I think Syria
safer?’ ‘The safest place in the east,’ I said,
‘was India.’ Feelings of pity for God’s ancient
people, and having the awful importance of eternal
things impressed on my mind, by the seriousness
of their inquiries as to what would become of them,
relieved me from the pressure of my comparatively
insignificant distresses. I, a poor Gentile, blest,
honoured, and loved, secured for ever by the everlasting
covenant, whilst the children of the kingdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
are still lying in outward darkness! Well
does it become me to be thankful.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn did not discourage the love of disputation
manifested by the natives, hoping it might
open the way for impressing the truth, and finding
that his assistant had already become interested in
the gospel history. But in consequence of his removing
from the city to the suburbs, that he might
enjoy a pleasant garden and a purer air, he was not
so much in the way of interruption, and his visiters
became less numerous. In that retirement, by the
side of a clear stream, and amidst vines and orange
trees, he devoted himself constantly to the completion
of his important task.</p>

<p>The curiosity and interest with which the missionary
was regarded, was not confined to a few
private individuals of Shiraz. The Professor of
Mohammedan law agreed to hold a public dispute
with him, and we abridge the account of the meeting
as given by Mr. Martyn, that our readers may
have an idea of the kind of arguments used in favour
of the imposture of Mohammed, and against
the truth of the gospel.</p>

<p>“He talked for a full hour about the soul: its being
distinct from the body, superior to the brutes,
&amp;c.; about God, his unity, invisibility, and other obvious
and acknowledged truths. After this followed
another discourse. At length, after clearing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
way for miles around, he said, ‘that philosophers
had proved, that a single being could produce but
a single being; that the first thing God had created
was <em>Wisdom</em>,—a being perfectly one with him; after
that, the souls of men, and the seventh heaven;
and so on, till he produced matter, which is merely
passive.’ He illustrated the theory, by comparing
all being to a circle: at one extremity of the diameter
is God, at the opposite extremity of the diameter
is matter, than which, nothing in the world is
meaner. Rising from thence, the highest stage of
matter is connected with the lowest stage of vegetation;
the highest of the vegetable world, with
the lowest of the animal, and so on, till we approach
the point from which all proceeded. ‘But,’
said he, ‘you will observe, that next to God, something
ought to be, which is equal to God; for since
it is equally near, it possesses equal dignity. What
this is, philosophers are not agreed upon. ‘You,’
said he, ‘say it is Christ: but we, that it is the
Spirit of the Prophets. All this is what the philosophers
have proved, independently of any particular
religion.’ There were a hundred things in
the Professor’s harangue, that might have been
excepted against, as mere dreams, supported by no
evidence; but I had no inclination to call in question
dogmas, on the truth or falsehood of which,
nothing in religion depended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“The Professor, at the close of one of his long
speeches, said to me, ‘You see how much there is
to be said on these subjects; several visits will be
necessary; we must come to the point by degrees.’
Perceiving how much he dreaded a close discussion,
I did not mean to hurry him, but let him talk
on, not expecting we should have any thing about
Mohammedism the first night. But at the instigation
of the Jew, I said, ‘Sir, you see that Abdoolghunee
is anxious that you should say something
about Islam.’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He was much displeased at being
brought so prematurely to the weak point, but
could not decline accepting so direct a challenge.
‘Well,’ said he to me, ‘I must ask you a few
questions. Why do you believe in Christ?’—He
then enumerated the persons who had spoken of the
miracles of Mohammed, and told a long story about
Salmon, the Persian, who had come to Mohammed.
I asked, ‘whether this Salmon had written an account
of the miracles he had seen?’ He confessed
that he had not. ‘Nor,’ said I, ‘have you a single
witness to the miracles of Mohammed.’ He then
tried to show, that though they had not, there was
still sufficient evidence. ‘For,’ said he, ‘suppose
five hundred persons should say that they heard
some particular thing of a hundred persons who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
were with Mohammed,—would that be sufficient
evidence, or not?’ ‘Whether it be or not,’ said I,
‘you have no such evidence as that, nor any thing
like it; but if you have, as they are something like
witnesses, we must proceed to examine them, and
see whether their testimony deserves credit.’</p>

<p>“After this, the Koran was mentioned; but as
the company began to thin, and the great man had
not a sufficient audience before whom to display
his eloquence, the dispute was not so brisk. He
did not, indeed, seem to think it worth while to
notice my objections. He mentioned a well known
sentence in the Koran, as being inimitable. I produced
another sentence, and begged to know why
it was inferior to the Koranic one. He declined
saying why, under pretext that it required such
a knowledge of rhetoric, in order to understand
his proofs, as I probably did not possess. A
scholar afterwards came to Seid Ali, with twenty
reasons for preferring Mohammed’s sentence to
mine.”</p>

<p>“It was midnight when dinner, or rather supper,
was brought in: it was a sullen meal. The great
man was silent, and I was sleepy. Seid Ali, however,
had not had enough. While burying his
hand in the dish of the professor, he softly mentioned
some more of my objections. He was so
vexed, that he scarcely answered any thing; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
after supper, told a very long story, all reflecting
upon me.”</p>

<p>His account of a subsequent appearance before a
celebrated Soofie, will further exemplify the character
of the learned men of India, who persist in
rejecting the truth.</p>

<p>“In the evening we went to pay a long-promised
visit to Mirza Abulcasim, one of the most renowned
Soofies in all Persia. We found several
persons sitting in an open court, in which a few
greens and flowers were placed; the master was in
a corner. He was a very fresh-looking old man,
with a silver beard. I was surprised to observe
the downcast and sorrowful looks of the assembly,
and still more at the silence which reigned. After
sitting some time in expectation, and being not at
all disposed to waste my time in sitting there, I
said softly to Seid Ali, ‘What is this?’ He said,
‘It is the custom here, to think much, and speak
little.’ ‘May I ask the master a question?’ said
I. With some hesitation he consented to let me:
so I begged Jaffier Ali to inquire, ‘Which is the
way to be happy?’</p>

<p>“This he did in his own manner: he began by
observing, that ‘there was a great deal of misery in
the world, and that the learned shared as largely
in it as the rest; that I wished, therefore, to know
what we must do to escape it.’ The master replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
that ‘for his part, he did not know, but that
it was usually said that the subjugation of the passions
was the shortest way to happiness.’</p>

<p>“After a considerable pause, I ventured to ask,
‘what were his feelings in the prospect of death;
hope, or fear; or neither?’ ‘Neither,’ said he;
and that ‘pleasure and pain were both alike.’ I
asked, ‘whether he had attained this apathy?’ He
said, ‘No.’ ‘Why do you think it attainable?’ He
could not tell. ‘Why do you think that pleasure
and pain are not the same?’ said Seid Ali, taking
his master’s part. ‘Because,’ said I, ‘I have the
evidence of my senses for it. And you also act as
if there was a difference. Why do you eat, but that
you fear pain?’ These silent sages sat unmoved.”</p>

<p>A defence of the religion of the Koran was also
published in Arabic, by the principal theological
professor, or instructer of Mohammedan priests,
upon which much labour had been spent, and
which was pronounced to be the best work on
the subject that had ever appeared. The work
concluded with an appeal to Mr. Martyn, to consider
the subject, and confess the truth of Mohammedism.
He immediately wrote a reply to it in
Persian, exposing the heresy and evil of the false
faith, and showing the evidences of the Christian religion;
appealing, in turn, to the Mussulman author
to view the subject impartially, and to embrace the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
truth without fear of the contempt, or even death it
might cost him. The learned men of the sect were
very fond of arguing with Mr. Martyn on the subject;
but as their desire was not humbly to seek
the way of God, but to indulge their love of debate,
and to display their skill in it, there was little good
effected by their conversations. The nephew of
the prince said, in the true spirit of Mohammed,
that the proper answer to the missionary was the
sword; but the prince himself acknowledged that
his faith in the false prophet was shaken, and
greatly praised the reply of Mr. Martyn, who,
when he was asked by the prince, what were the
laws of Christianity, (meaning how often it required
its believers to pray, wash, &amp;c.,) said, that it had
two commandments—“Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all
thy strength; and thy neighbour, as thyself.” In
these debates he had to endure great contempt from
his opponents, which is one of the severest trials
a man of honourable feeling, and a minister of the
gospel, can be called to suffer. It must have been
a great aggravation of the sorrows of our Redeemer,
after he had come from Heaven, out of pure mercy to
men, to find himself disbelieved, and his affectionate
entreaties, and the proofs of his doctrine, treated
with ridicule and scorn, by the very persons he
had come to seek and to save.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>It was the recollection of what Christ had suffered
in this respect, that supported Mr. Martyn
amidst the scoffs of the proud Mohammedans; and
he often repeated the verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If on my face, for thy dear name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shame and reproaches be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All hail reproach, and welcome shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If thou remember me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although these men pass for sages amongst their
own people, they were very ignorant, in comparison
with well-educated Europeans. One of the
sectaries, for instance, maintained against Mr.
Martyn, that there was no difference between
pleasure and pain; and he was once called upon
in a large company, assembled at the house of the
prime minister of the territory, to prove that the
earth moves: but no one understood his explanations.
Sometimes he would be questioned on
great principles which naturally led him to speak
of the gospel; but as soon as he mentioned any of
its doctrines, they would divert the conversation
to some of the ridiculous ideas, upon which they
were accustomed to waste their thoughts. For
instance, one of the men who accompanied him
as a guard to visit the ruins of Persepolis, a celebrated
ancient city, not far from Shiraz, “often
broke a long silence,” he says, “by a sudden question
of this sort: ‘Sir, what is the chief good of
life?’ I replied, ‘The love of God:’ ‘What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
next?’ ‘The love of man.’ ‘That is,’ said he, ‘to
have men love us, or to love them?’ ‘To love
them.’ He did not seem to agree with me. Another
time he asked, ‘Who were the worst people in the
world?’ I said ‘Those who know their duty,
and do not practise it.’ At the house where I was
entertained, they asked me the question which the
Lord once asked, ‘What think ye of Christ?’ I
generally tell them at first, what they expect to
hear, ‘The Son of God;’ but this time I said,
‘The same as you say,—the word of God.’ ‘Was
he a Prophet?’ ‘Yes, in some sense, he was a
Prophet; but, what it chiefly concerns us to know,
he was an Atonement for the sins of men.’ Not
understanding this, they made no reply. They
next asked, ‘What did I think of the soul?’ was it
out of the body or in the body? I supposed the
latter. ‘No,’ they said, ‘it was neither the one
nor the other; but next to it, and the mover of the
body.’”</p>

<p>We have some other specimens of these discussions.</p>

<p>“Aga Ali, of Media, came, and with him and
Mirza Ali, I had a long and warm discussion about
the essentials of Christianity. The Mede seeing
us at work upon the epistles, said, ‘he should be
glad to read them; as for the gospels, they were
nothing but tales, which were of no use to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
for instance,’ said he, ‘if Christ raised four hundred
dead to life, what is that to me?’ I said, ‘It certainly
was of importance; for his works were a
reason for our depending upon his words.’ ‘What
did he say,’ asked he, ‘that was not known before:
the love of God, humility,—who does not know
these things?’ ‘Were these things,’ said I, ‘known
before Christ, either among Greeks or Romans,
with all their philosophy?’ They averred that
the Hindoo book Juh contained precepts of this
kind. I questioned its antiquity; ‘but however
that may be,’ I added, ‘Christ came not to <em>teach</em>,
so much as to <em>die</em>; the truths I spoke of, as confirmed
by his miracles, were those relating to his
person, such as, ‘Come unto me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.’
Here Mirza Seid Ali told him that I had professed
to have no doubt of my salvation. He asked what
I meant? I told him, ‘that though sin still remained,
I was assured that it should not regain
dominion; and that I should never come into condemnation,
but was accepted in the Beloved.’ Not
a little surprised, he asked Mirza Seid Ali whether
he comprehended this? ‘No,’ said he, ‘nor Mirza
Ibraheem, to whom I mentioned it.’ The Mede
again turning to me, asked, ‘how do you know
this? how do you know you have experienced the
second birth?’ ‘Because,’ said I, ‘we have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Spirit of the Father; what he wishes, we wish;
what he hates, we hate.’ Here he began to be a
little more calm and less contentious, and mildly
asked, how I had obtained this peace of mind;
‘Was it merely those books?’ said he, taking up
some of our sheets. I told him ‘These books,
with prayer.’ ‘What was the beginning of it,’ said
he, ‘the society of some friends?’ I related to him
my religious history, the substance of which was,
that I took my bible before God, in prayer, and
prayed for forgiveness through Christ, assurance
of it through his Spirit, and grace to obey his commandments.
They then both asked whether the
same benefit would be conferred on them? I replied;
‘I bring you this message from God, that
he who, despairing of himself, rests for righteousness
on the Son of God, shall receive the gift of the
Holy Ghost; and to this I can add my testimony,
if that be worth any thing, that I have found the
promise fulfilled in myself; but if you should not
find it so in you, accuse not the gospel of falsehood;
it is possible that your faith might not be sincere;
indeed, so fully am I persuaded that you do not
believe on the Son of God, that if you were to
entreat ever so earnestly for baptism, I should not
dare to administer it at this time, when you have
shown so many signs of an unhumbled heart.’
‘What! would you have me believe,’ said he, ‘as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
a child?’ ‘Yes,’ said I. ‘True,’ said he, ‘I think
that is the only way.’ Aga Ali said no more but
‘Certainly he is a good man!’”</p>

<p>“Aga Neeser came, and talked most captiously
and irrelevantly against all revealed religion. Three
years ago, he had thrown off the shackles of Mohammed,
and advised me to do the same with my
yoke. I told him, that I preferred my yoke to his
freedom. He was for sending me naked into a
wilderness; but I would rather be a child under
the restraints of a parent, who would provide me
with food and clothing, and be my protector and
guide. To every thing I said, he had but one
answer. ‘God is the sole agent; sin and holiness,
happiness and misery, cause and effect, are all perfectly
one.’ Finding him determined to amuse
himself in this way, I said, ‘These things will do
very well for the present, while reclining in gardens
and smoking pipes; but not for a dying hour. How
many years of life remain? You are about thirty,
perhaps thirty more remain. How swiftly have
the last thirty passed: how soon will the next
thirty be gone: and then we shall see. If you are
right, I lose nothing; if I am right, you lose your
soul. Leaving out the consideration of all religion,
it is probable that the next world may be akin to
this, and our relation to both not dissimilar. But
here we see that childhood is a preparation for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
manhood, and that neglect of the proper employments
of childhood entails miseries in riper years.’
The thought of death, and of separation from
his pleasures, made him serious; or perhaps he
thought it useless to press me with any more of his
opinions.”</p>

<p>Such was the state of the minds of the people
whom he hoped to bring to a reception of the
gospel, to renounce Mohammed, and “confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father!” We may learn more of the nature of
their religion, by his account of the manner in
which their principal fast is observed. It is called
the fast of Ramazan, and is directed by the Koran
to be kept during the month called by that name.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 20th.</em>—First day of the fast of Ramazan.
All the family had been up in the night, to take an
unseasonable meal, in order to fortify themselves
for the abstinence of the day. It was curious to
observe the effects of the fast in the house. The
master was scolding and beating his servants; they
equally peevish and insolent; and the beggars more
than ordinarily importunate and clamorous. At
noon, all the city went to the grand mosque.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> My
host came back with an account of new vexations
there. He was chatting with a friend, near the
door, when a great preacher, Hagi Mirza, arrived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
with hundreds of followers. ‘Why do you not
say your prayers?’ said the new comers to the
two friends. ‘We have finished,’ said they. ‘Well,’
said the other, ‘if you cannot pray a second time
with us, you had better move out of the way.’
Rather than join such turbulent zealots, they retired.
The reason of this unceremonious address
was, that these loving disciples had a desire to pray
all in a row with their master, which, it seems, is
the custom. There is no public service in the
mosque; every man there prays for himself.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 22d.</em>—Sunday. My friends returned
from the mosque, full of indignation at what they
had witnessed there. The former governor of
Bushire complained to the vizier, in the mosque,
that some of his servants had treated him brutally.
The vizier, instead of attending to his complaint,
ordered them to do their work a second time;
which they did, kicking and beating him with
their slippers, in the most ignominious way, before
all the mosque. This unhappy people groan
under the tyranny of their governors; yet nothing
subdues or tames them. Happy Europe! how
has God favoured the sons of Japheth, by causing
them to embrace the gospel! How dignified are
all the nations of Europe compared with this
nation! Yet the people are clever and intelligent,
and more calculated to become great and powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
than any of the nations of the east, had they a good
government, and the Christian religion.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 1st.</em>—Thousands every day assemble at
the mosque; it is quite a lounge with them. Each,
as soon as he has said his prayers, sits down and
talks to his friend. The multitude press to hear
Hagi Mohammed Hasan. One day they thronged
him so much that he made some error in his prostrations.
This put him into such a passion, that
he wished that Omar’s<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> curse might come upon
him, if he preached to them again. However, a
day or two after, he thought better of it. This
preacher is famous for letting out his money for
interest; and therefore, in spite of his eloquence,
he is not very popular.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 7th.</em>—I was surprised by a visit from the
great Soofie doctor, who, while most of the people
were asleep, came to me for some wine. I plied
him with questions innumerable; but he returned
nothing but incoherent answers, and sometimes no
answer at all. Having laid aside his turban, he
put on his night-cap, and soon fell asleep upon the
carpet. Whilst he lay there, his disciples came,
but would not believe, when I told them who was
there, till they came and saw the sage asleep.
When he awoke, they came in and seated themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
at the greatest possible distance, and were
all as still as if in a church.</p>

<p>“The real state of this man seems to be despair,
and it is well if it do not end in madness. I
preached to him the kingdom of God: mentioning
particularly how I had found peace from the Son
of God and the Spirit of God: through the first,
forgiveness; through the second, sanctification.
He said it was good, but said it with the same
unconcern with which he admits all manner of
things, however contradictory. Poor soul! he is
sadly bewildered.</p>

<p>“At a garden called Shah Chiragh, in which is
the tomb of the brother of one of the Imans, who
was killed on the spot, a miracle is wrought every
Ramazan. The proprietor of the garden, in whose
family it has been for ages, finds its supposed
sanctity abundantly profitable, as he is said to
make $9,000 a year of it. To keep alive the zeal
of the people, who make their offerings there every
day, he procures a villager, who pretends to be
sick, and crying to Ali<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for help; and then, on the
appointed day, recovers. Though this farce is
played off every year, the simpletons are never
undeceived. Presents of sheep, fowls, sweetmeats,
money, flowed in upon the proprietor, who skilfully
turned all to the best advantage. Those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
wished to see the man’s face, were to pay so much,
those who were anxious to touch him, were to pay
so much more; and so on.</p>

<p>“On two days in the Ramazan, tragedies were
acted at our house, in the women’s court. Two
or three men, dressed in the Khan’s court-robes,
spouted and sung for an hour, before an immense
concourse of women, all veiled. The subject on
the first day was the death of Mohammed; on the
second, that of Iman Hosyn.”</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 18th.</em>—“The Ramazan ended, or ought
to have ended, but the moon disappointed them.
The Moollahs not having seen the new moon,
would not allow the fast to be over, and the people
were, in consequence, all in confusion; for not
having eaten in the night, they were not at all
disposed to go through the day fasting. At last
some witnesses appeared, who vowed that they had
seen the silver bow. These were from the prince;
but the Moollahs refused to admit them till seventy-two
of the same kind bore the same testimony.
This was no great number for a prince to produce;
so the seventy-two appeared, and the feast was
proclaimed.”</p>

</div>


<p>The Persian version of the New Testament
being now nearly finished, Mr. Martyn, with his
native assistant, commenced the translation of the
Psalms of David into Persian, from the Hebrew.
From his diary in the beginning of 1812, it appears
that he was not satisfied with his Persian New
Testament.</p>

<p>“The last has been, in some respects, a memorable
year. I have been led, by what I have reason
to consider as the particular providence of God, to
this place, and have undertaken an important work,
which has gone on without material interruption,
and is now nearly finished. I like to find myself
employed usefully, in a way I did not expect or
foresee, especially if my own will is in any degree
crossed by the work unexpectedly assigned me;
as there is then reason to believe that God is acting.
The present year will probably be a perilous
one; but my life is of little consequence, whether
I live to finish the Persian New Testament, or do
not. I look back with pity and shame upon my
former self, and on the importance I then attached
to my life and labours. The more I see of my
own works, the more I am ashamed of them.
Coarseness and clumsiness mar all the works of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
man. I am sick when I look at man, and his
wisdom, and his doings; and am relieved only by
reflecting, that we have a city whose builder and
maker is God. The least of <em>His</em> works it is
refreshing to look at. A dried leaf, or a straw,
makes me feel myself in good company: complacency
and admiration take place of disgust.</p>

<p>“I compared, with pain, our Persian translation
with the original; to say nothing of the precision
and elegance of the sacred text, its perspicuity
is that which sets at defiance all attempts to equal
it.”</p>

<p>But the more he read and studied the sacred scriptures,
the stronger attachment he felt towards them,
and so far from becoming tired of them, from having
them so constantly in his hands, he used to
turn to them for comfort in all his sorrows.</p>

<p>“<em>Feb. 2d.</em>—From what I suffer in this city, I
can understand the feelings of Lot. The face of
the poor Russian appears to me like the face of an
angel, because he does not tell lies. Heaven will
be heaven, because there will not be one liar there.
The word of God is more precious to me at this
time than I ever remember it to have been; and
of all the promises in it, none is more sweet to me
than this—‘He shall reign till he hath put all enemies
under his feet.’”</p>

<p>“<em>Feb. 3d.</em>—A packet arrived from India, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
a single letter for me. It was some disappointment
to me; but let me be satisfied with my God;
and if I cannot have the comfort of hearing from
my friends, let me return with thankfulness to his
word, which is a treasure of which none envy me
the possession, and where I can find what will
more than compensate for the loss of earthly enjoyments.
Resignation to the will of God is a lesson
which I must learn, and which I trust he is teaching
me.”</p>

<p>In the earlier part of his life he felt a great increase
of spiritual feeling and enjoyment, in consequence
of having for a time scarcely any other
book to read than the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn was sometimes encouraged to believe
that the constant perusal of the scriptures had
made a serious impression on the mind of Mirza
Seid Ali, his assistant in translation. He was evidently
interested in his employment, and even went
so far as to acknowledge his belief in Christ, as the
Son of God, and to express his willingness to trust
in him for salvation, and make a public profession
of his faith. But his conduct at other times manifested,
that he had only a belief in these truths as
facts, and that he did not really submit himself to God
by faith and repentance. His candour was evinced
in a confession which he made, on a point in which
the natural disposition of his countrymen inclines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
them to be very perverse. He had been boasting
of the humility and simplicity of his sect, the
Soofies; upon which Mr. Martyn remarked, that if
he was really humble, he would not dispute so
boldly as he did, but would be like a child. Upon
hearing this he did not speak, except to acknowledge,
“True, I have no humility;” and afterwards,
in a tone of distress, said, “The truth is, we are in a
state of compound ignorance; ignorant, yet ignorant
of our ignorance.” When their translation
was finished, Mr. Martyn remarked, “Mirza Seid
Ali never now argues against the truth, nor makes
any remarks but of a serious kind. He speaks of
his dislike to some of the Soofies, on account of
their falsehood and drunken habits. This approach
to the love of morality, is the best sign of a change
for the better, which I have yet seen in him. As
often as he produces the New Testament, which
he always does when any of his friends come, his
brother and cousin ridicule him; but he tells them
that, supposing no other benefit to have been derived,
it is certainly something better to have
gained all this information about the religion of
Christians, than to have loitered away the year in
the garden.”</p>

<p>The Persian New Testament was completed in
February, 1812, and the Psalms in March; and on
the 24th May, Mr. Martyn left Shiraz, in company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>with an English clergyman, for the purpose of presenting
a written copy of the Testament to the
king of Persia, who was encamped between Shiraz
and Tebriz. Before he left Shiraz, he maintained
the doctrine that Christ was God and the Creator,
before a large company of Moollahs, in the palace
of one of the princes.</p>

<p>On arriving at the camp about the 9th of June,
he waited on the prime minister, to learn how he
should be able to lay the book before the king.
The minister detained him two hours in a debate
respecting the Christian religion, mixed, as usual,
with ridiculous opinions on all subjects. At the
house of the vizier, some days afterwards, he was
attacked on the same subject, before a large company.
Towards the close of the discussion the
vizier told him, “You had better say, God is God,
and Mohammed is the prophet of God;” Mr.
Martyn at once replied, “God is God, and Jesus
is the Son of God,” which excited their anger, and
they left him with great contempt. “Thus,” said
he, “I walked away alone to my tent, to pass the
rest of the day, in heat and dirt. What have I
done, thought I, to merit all this scorn? Nothing,
I trust, but bearing testimony to Jesus. I thought
over these things in prayer, and my troubled heart
found that peace which Christ hath promised to his
disciples.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>The vizier having sent him word that no Englishman
could be permitted to see the king, unless presented
by the English ambassador, or having a
letter of introduction from him, Mr. Martyn proceeded
towards Tebriz, his residence, in company
with the English clergyman, and some natives for
servants and guides. Tebriz or Tauris, is in the
northern part of Persia, seven hundred miles from
Shiraz, and at least twenty-five hundred from Calcutta.
“As I sat down in the dust, on a shady
side of a walled village, by which we passed, and
surveyed the plains over which our road lay, I
sighed at the thought of my dear friends in India
and England; of the vast regions I must traverse
before I can get to either, and of the various and
unexpected hindrances, which present themselves to
my going forward; I comfort myself with the hope
that my God has something for me to do, by thus
delaying my departure.” They met with much
insulting treatment on the road, especially from the
various officers and servants of the king, who had
possession of the best accommodations, and seemed
to delight in an opportunity of ill-treating Europeans.
On the 25th of June, they were both seized
with fever, and unable to proceed. They were
afraid they would be unable to procure food and
lodging, as their money failed, and no one would lend
to them, until a poor mule-driver became security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
for them. His journal is little else than a detail of
sufferings. He appears to have joined a caravan of
travellers going the same route.</p>

<p>“We had now eaten nothing for two days. My
mind was much disordered from head-ache and
giddiness, from which I was seldom free; but my
heart, I trust, was with Christ and his saints. To
live much longer in this world of sickness and pain
seemed no way desirable; the most favourite prospects
of my heart seemed very poor and childish;
and cheerfully would I have exchanged them all for
the unfading inheritance.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 27th.</em>—My Armenian servant was attacked
in the same way. The rest did not get me the
things that I wanted, so that I passed the third day
in the same exhausted state; my head, too, was
tortured with shocking pains, such as, together with
the horror I felt at being exposed to the sun, showed
me plainly to what to ascribe my sickness. Towards
evening, two more of our servants were
attacked in the same way, and lay groaning from
pains in the head.”</p>

<p>“<em>June 28th.</em>—All were much recovered, but in
the afternoon I again relapsed. During a high
fever, Mr. C—— read to me, in bed, the epistle to
the Ephesians, and I never felt the consolations of
that divine revelation of mysteries more sensibly
and solemnly. Rain in the night prevented our
setting off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“<em>June 29th.</em>—My ague and fever returned, with
such a head-ache, that I was almost frantic. Again
and again I said to myself, ‘Let patience have her
perfect work;’ and kept pleading the promises,
‘When thou passest through the waters, I will be
with thee,’ &amp;c.; and the Lord did not withhold
his presence. I endeavoured to repel all the disordered
thoughts that the fever occasioned, and to
keep in mind that all was friendly; a friendly Lord
presiding; and nothing exercising me but what
would show itself at last friendly. A violent perspiration
at last relieved the acute pain in my head,
and my heart rejoiced; but as soon as that was
over, the exhaustion it occasioned, added to the
fatigue from the pain, left me in as low a state of
depression as ever I was in. I seemed about to
sink into a long fainting fit, and I almost wished it;
but at this moment, a little after midnight, I was
summoned to mount my horse, and set out, rather
dead than alive. We had a thunder-storm with
hail.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 1st.</em>—A long and tiresome march to Sarehund:
in twenty-eight miles there was no village.
They had nothing to sell but buttermilk and bread;
but a servant of Abbas Mirza, happening to be at
the same caravansera, sent us some flesh of a
mountain cow, which he had shot the day before.
All day I had scarcely the right recollection of
myself, from the violence of the ague.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“<em>July 2d.</em>—At two in the morning we set out.
I hardly know when I have been so disordered. I
had little or no recollection of things, and what I
did remember, at times, of happy scenes in India
or England, served only to embitter my present
situation. Soon after removing into the air, I was
seized with a violent ague, and in this state I went
on till sun-rise. At fourteen miles, we found a fine
caravansera, apparently very little used, as the grass
was growing in the court. There was nothing all
round but the barren rocks, which generally
roughen the country before the mountain rears
its height. Such an edifice, in such a situation,
was cheering. Soon after, we came to a river,
over which was a high bridge; I sat down in the
shade under it, with two camel-drivers. The
caravan, as it happened, forded the river, and
passed on, without my perceiving it. Mr. C——,
seeing no signs of me, returned, and after looking
about for some time, espied my horse grazing; he
concluded immediately that the horse had flung me
from the bridge into the river, and was almost
ready to give me up for lost. My speedy appearance
from under the bridge relieved his terror and
anxiety. The pass was a mere nothing to those
at Bushire; in fact it was no part of the mountain
we climbed, but only a few hills. In a natural
opening in the mountains, on the other side, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
river, with most of its bed dry; and over it a bridge
of many arches, which led us to an unwalled village,
surrounded by corn-fields, which we reached at
ten o’clock. Half the people still continue ill;
for myself, I am, through God’s infinite mercy,
recovering.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 3d.</em>—Started at three, full three hours
after we ought, and, as was to be expected, we all
got ill again, from being exposed to the sun six
hours; for we did not get to our ground, Turcoman,
till eleven o’clock. It was a poor village among
the hills, over which our whole way lay, from
Mianu. Ascending one, and descending another,
was the whole of the variety, so that I do not know
when we have had a more tiresome day.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 4th.</em>—I so far prevailed as to get the
caravan into motion at midnight. Lost our way in
the night, but arriving at a village were set right
again. At eight came to Kilk caravansera, but not
stopping there, went on to a village, where we
arrived at half-past nine. The baggage not coming
up till long after, we got no breakfast till one
o’clock. In consequence of all these things, want
of sleep, want of refreshment, and exposure to the
sun, I was presently in a high fever; which raged
so furiously all the day, that I was nearly delirious,
and it was some time before I could get the right
recollection of myself. I almost despaired, and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
now, of getting alive through this unfortunate journey.
Last night I felt remarkably well, calm, and
composed, and sat reflecting on my heavenly rest,
with more sweetness of soul, abstraction from the
world, and solemn views of God, than I have had
for a long time. Oh! for such sacred hours!
This short and painful life would scarcely be felt,
could I live thus at heaven’s gate. It being impossible
to continue my journey in my present
state, and one of the servants also being so ill that
he could not move with safety, we determined to
halt one day at the village, and sent on a messenger
to Sir Gore Ousely, the ambassador, who was at
Tebriz, informing him of our approach.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 5th.</em>—Slept all day, and at sun-rise prepared
to proceed all the way to Tebriz, or at least
to Seid Abad; but we did not set out till one in the
morning. I was again dreadfully disordered with
head-ache and fever. We got into a wretched
hovel, where the raging fever almost deprived me
of reason. In the cool of the evening we set out
to go to Seid Abad, distant about twelve miles.
When the caravan arrived near Seid Abad, it was
a dark night, about eleven o’clock, and not one of
the party knew where it was, nor could we discover
it by the barking of the dogs, the usual sign. Once
we heard the bark, and made sure of having attained
our object; but found only some shepherds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
keeping watch over their flocks by night. These
boors showed us which road to take, which we
soon found ended in nothing; so returning, we tried
to induce one of them to serve as a guide, with the
promise of any sum of money he required: but all
in vain. The only thing that remained to be done
was to lie down on the spot, and wait patiently for
the day: which I did, and caught such a cold, as,
with all our other exposures, consummated my
disorders. As soon as it was day, we found our
way to the village, where Dr. —— was waiting
for us. Not being able to stay for us, he went on
to Tebriz, and we as far as Wasmuch, where he
promised to procure for us a fine upper room furnished;
but when we arrived, they denied that
there was any such place; at last, after an hour’s
threatening, we got admittance to it. An hour
before break of day I left it, in hopes of reaching
Tebriz before sun-rise. Some of the people seemed
to feel compassion for me, and asked me if I was
not very ill. At last I reached the gate, and feebly
asked for a man to show me the way to the ambassador’s.”</p>

<p>At Tebriz he was confined two months by a fever,
from which he did not expect to recover. He
wrote to a friend—“We who are in Jesus, have
the privilege of viewing life and death as nearly
the same, since both are ours; and I thank a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
gracious Lord that sickness never came at a
time when I was more free from apparent reasons
for living. Nothing, seemingly, remains for me to
do, but to follow the rest of my family to the tomb.”</p>

<p>The New Testament, which he was thus prevented
from giving, in person, to the Persian monarch,
was, after Mr. Martyn’s death, presented by the
ambassador; and the king acknowledged the gift
in the following letter:</p>

<p>“In the name of the Almighty God, whose glory
is most excellent.</p>

<p>“It is our august command, that the dignified and
excellent, our trusty, faithful, and loyal well-wisher,
Sir Gore Ousely, Baronet, his Britannic Majesty’s
Ambassador Extraordinary, (after being honoured
and exalted with the expressions of our highest
regard and consideration,) should know, that the
copy of the Gospel, which was translated into Persian
by the learned exertions of the late Rev. Henry
Martyn, and which has been presented to us by
your Excellency, on the part of the high, dignified,
learned, and enlightened Society of Christians,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
united for the purpose of spreading abroad the Holy
Books of the Religion of Jesus, (upon whom, and
upon all Prophets, be peace and blessings!) has
reached us, and has proved highly acceptable to our
august mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“In truth, through the learned and unremitting
exertions of the Rev. Henry Martyn, it has been
translated in a style most befitting sacred books;
that is, in an easy and simple diction. Formerly,
the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John, were known in Persia; but now the whole
of the New Testament is completed in a most excellent
manner: and this circumstance has been
an additional source of pleasure to our enlightened
and august mind. Even the four Evangelists,
which were known in this country, had never been
before explained in so clear and luminous a manner.
We therefore have been particularly delighted
with this copious and complete translation. Please
the most merciful God, we shall command the
select servants, who are admitted to our presence,
to read to us the above mentioned book, from the
beginning to the end, that we may, in the most
minute manner, hear and comprehend its contents.</p>

<p>“Your excellency will be pleased to rejoice the
hearts of the above mentioned dignified, learned,
and enlightened Society, with assurances of our
highest regard and approbation; and to inform those
excellent individuals, who are so virtuously engaged
in disseminating and making known the true meaning
and intent of the holy gospel, and other points
in sacred books, that they are deservedly honoured
with our royal favour. Your excellency must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
consider yourself as bound to fulfil this royal
request.”</p>

<p>The ambassador afterwards took the translation
to St. Petersburg, in Russia, where it was printed.</p>

<p>His principal design in visiting Persia being
thus accomplished, and the journey not having contributed
to his health, Mr. Martyn, as soon as he
had recovered from the attack of fever, determined
to return to England. Shortly before leaving
Tebriz, he wrote thus in a letter:</p>

<p>“It has pleased God to restore me to life and
health again: not that I have yet recovered my
former strength, but I consider myself sufficiently
restored to prosecute my journey. My daily
prayer is, that my late chastisement may have its
intended effect, and make me, all the rest of my
days, more humble and less self-confident. Self-confidence
has often let me down fearful lengths;
and would, without God’s gracious interference,
prove my endless perdition. I seem to be made
to feel this evil of my heart, more than any other,
at this time. In prayer, or when I write or converse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
on the subject, Christ appears to me my life
and strength; but at other times, I am thoughtless
and bold, as if I had all life and strength in myself.
Such neglects on our part are a diminution of our
joys.—I mentioned my conversing sometimes on
divine subjects. In these I am sometimes led on
by the Soofie Persians, and tell them all I know of
the very recesses of the sanctuary. But to give an
account of all my discussions with these mystic
philosophers, must be reserved to the time of
our meeting.—Do I dream! that I venture to
think and write of such an event as that? Is it
possible that we shall ever meet again below?
Though it is possible, I dare not indulge such a
pleasing hope.</p>

<p>“In three days I intend setting my horse’s head
towards Constantinople, distant about one thousand
three hundred miles. Nothing, I think, will occasion
any further detention here, if I can procure
servants who know both Persian and Turkish.
Ignorant as I am of Turkish, should I be taken ill
on the road, my case would be pitiable indeed.
The ambassador and his suite are still here; his
and Lady Ousely’s attentions to me during my illness
have been unremitted. The prince Abbas
Mirza, the wisest of the king’s sons, and heir to
the throne, was here some time after my arrival.
I much wished to present a copy of the Persian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
New Testament to him, but I could not rise from
my bed. The book, however, will be given him
by the ambassador. Public curiosity about the
gospel, now, for the first time in the memory of
the modern Persians, introduced into the country,
is a good deal excited here and at Shiraz, and in
other places; so that, upon the whole, I am thankful
for having been led hither, and detained; though
my residence in this country has been attended
with many unpleasant circumstances. The way
of the kings of the east is <em>preparing</em>: thus much
may be said with safety, but little more. The
Persians will also probably take the lead in the
march to Sion.”</p>

<p>On the second of September he left Tebriz, on
horseback, with two Armenian servants, one of
whom spoke Turkish, and a little Persian. His
diary will best exhibit the hardships of the journey,
and the pious feelings with which he endured
them.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 4th.</em>—At sun-rise mounted my horse, and
proceeded north-west, through a pass in the mountains,
towards Murun. By the way, I sat down
by the brook, and there ate my bread and raisins,
and drank of the crystal stream; but either the
coldness of this unusual breakfast, or the riding after
it, did not at all agree with me. The heat oppressed
me much, and the road seemed intolerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
tedious; at last we got out from among the mountains,
and saw the village of Murun, in a fine valley
on the right. It was about eleven o’clock when
we reached it. As the Mihmander could not immediately
find a place to put me in, we had a complete
view of this village. They stared at my
European dress, but no disrespect was shown. I
was deposited, at last, with —— Khan, who was
seated in a place with three walls. Not at all disposed
to pass the day in company, as well as exposed,
I asked for another room; on which I was
shown to the stable, where there was a little place
partitioned off, but so as to admit a view of the
horses. The smell of the stable, though not in
general disagreeable to me, was so strong, that I
was quite unwell, and strangely dispirited and melancholy.
Immediately after dinner I fell fast asleep,
and slept four hours; after which I rose and ordered
them to prepare for the next journey. The
horses being changed here, it was some time
before they were brought, but by exerting myself,
we moved off by midnight. It was a most mild
and delightful night, and the pure air, after the
smell of the stable, was quite reviving. For once,
also, I travelled all the way without being sleepy;
and beguiled the hours of the night by thinking of
the 14th Psalm, especially the connection of the
last three verses with the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 5th.</em>—In five hours we were just on the
hills which face the pass out of the valley of
Murun, and in four hours and a half more, emerged
from between the two ridges of mountains, into the
valley of Gurjur. This long march was far from
being a fatiguing one. The air, the road, and my
spirits were good. Here I was well accommodated,
but had to mourn over my impatient temper
towards my servants; there is nothing that disturbs
my peace so much. How much more noble and
godlike to bear with calmness, and observe with
pity, rather than anger, the failings and offences of
others. O that I may, through grace, be enabled
to recollect myself in the time of temptation!
O that the Spirit of God may check my folly,
and, at such times, bring the lowly Saviour to my
view.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 6th.</em>—Soon after twelve we started with
fresh horses, and came to the Arar, or Araxes,
distant eight miles, and about as broad as the Isis,
with a current as strong as that of the Ganges.
The ferry-boat being on the other side, I lay down
to sleep till it came, but observing my servants do
the same, I was obliged to get up and exert myself.
It dawned, however, before we got over. The
boat was a huge fabric. The ferryman had only a
stick to push with: an oar, I dare say, he had
never seen or heard of, and many of my train had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
probably never floated before; so alien is a Persian
from every thing that belongs to shipping. We
landed safely on the other side in about two minutes.
We were four hours in reaching Nackshan, and
for half an hour more I was led from street to
street, till at last I was lodged in a wash-house
belonging to a great man, a corner of which was
cleaned out for me. It was near noon, and my
baggage had not arrived; so that I was obliged to
go without my breakfast; which was hard after a
ride for four hours in the sun. The baggage was
delayed so long, that I began to fear; at last, however,
it arrived. All the afternoon I slept, and at
sun-set arose, and continued wakeful till midnight,
when I roused my people, and with fresh horses
set out again. We travelled till sun-rise. I
scarcely perceived that we had been moving, a
Hebrew word, in the 16th Psalm, having led me
gradually into speculations on the eighth conjugation
of the Arabic verb. I am glad my philological
curiosity is revived, as my mind will be less liable
to idleness.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 7th.</em>—Arrived at Khoock, a poor village
distant twenty-two miles from Nackshan, nearly
west. I should have mentioned, that on descending
into the plain of Nackshan, my attention was
arrested by the appearance of a hoary mountain,
opposite to us at the other end, rising so high above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the rest, that they sunk into insignificance. It was
truly sublime, and the interest it excited was not
lessened, when, on inquiring its name, I was told
it was Agri, or Ararat. Thus I saw two remarkable
objects in one day, the Araxes, and Ararat. At
four in the afternoon we set out for Shurror. The
evening was pleasant; the ground over which we
passed was full of rich cultivation and verdure,
watered by many a stream, and containing forty
villages, most of them with the usual appendage
of gardens. To add to the scene, the great Ararat
was on our left. On the peak of that hill the
whole church was once contained; it has now
spread far and wide, even to the ends of the earth;
but the ancient vicinity of it knows it no more. I
fancied many a spot where Noah perhaps offered
his sacrifices; and the promise of God, ‘that seed-time
and harvest should not cease,’ appeared to me
to be more exactly fulfilled in the agreeable plain
in which it was spoken, than elsewhere; as I had
not seen such fertility in any part of the Shah’s
dominions. Here the blessed saint landed in a new
world; so may I, safe in Christ, outride the storm
of life, and land at last on one of the everlasting
hills!</p>

<p>“Night coming on, we lost our way, and got intercepted
by some deep ravines, into one of which
the horse that carried my trunks sunk so deep, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the water got into one of them, wetted the linen, and
spoiled some books. We went to another village,
where after a long delay, two aged men with silver
beards opened their house to us. Though it was
near midnight, I had a fire lighted to dry my books,
took some coffee, and sunk into deep sleep; from
which awaking at the earliest dawn of</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 8th.</em>—I roused the people, and had a
delightful ride to Shurror. Here I was accommodated
by the great man with a stable, or winter
room; for they build it in such a strange vicinity,
in order to have it warm in winter. At present,
while the weather is still hot, the smell is at times
overpowering. At eleven at night we moved off,
with fresh horses, for Duwala; but though we
had guides in abundance, we were not able to extricate
ourselves from the ravines with which this
village is surrounded. Procuring another man
from a village we happened to wander into, we at
last made our way, through grass and mire, to the
pass, which led us to a country as dry as the one
we had left was wet. Ararat was now quite near:
at the foot of it is Duwala, twenty-four miles from
Nackshan, where we arrived at seven in the morning
of</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 9th.</em>—As I had been thinking all night
of a Hebrew letter, I perceived little of the tediousness
of the way. I tried also some difficulties in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the 16th Psalm, without being able to master them.
All day on the 15th and 16th Psalms, and gained
some light into the difficulties. The villagers not
bringing the horses in time, we were not able to
go on at night; but I was not much concerned,
as I thereby gained some rest.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 10th.</em>—All day at the village, writing
down notes on the 15th and 16th Psalms. Moved
at midnight and arrived early in the morning at
Erivan.</p>

<p>“<em>Sept. 11th.</em>—I alighted at Hosyn Khan, the
governor’s palace, as it may be called, for he
seems to live in a style equal to that of a prince.
After sleeping two hours, I was summoned to his
presence. He at first took no notice of me, but
continued reading his Koran. After a compliment
or two he resumed his devotions. The next ceremony
was to exchange a rich shawl dress for a still
richer pelisse, on pretence of its being cold. The
next display was to call for his physician, who,
after respectfully feeling his pulse, stood on one
side: this was to show that he had a domestic
physician. His servants were most richly clad.
My letter from the ambassador, which till now had
lain neglected on the ground, was opened and read
by a moonshee. He heard with great interest
what Sir Gore had written about the translation
of the gospels. After this he was very kind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
attentive, and sent for Lieutenant M—— of the
engineers, who was stationed, with two serjeants,
at this fort. In the afternoon, the governor sent
for me again in private. A fountain, in a basin of
white marble, was playing before him, and in its
water grapes and melons were cooling; two time-pieces
were before him, to show the approach of
the time of lawful repast: below the window, at a
great depth, ran a broad and rapid stream, over
rocks and stones, under a bridge of two arches,
producing an agreeable murmur: on the other side
of the river were gardens, and a rich plain; and
directly in front, Ararat. He was now entirely
free from ceremony, but too much fatigued to converse.
I tried to begin a religious discussion, by
observing that ‘he was in one paradise now, and
was in quest of another hereafter,’ but this remark
produced no effect.”</p>

<p>The next day he went to Ech-Miazin, where
there are three churches of Greek Christians, and
a monastery. The worship and creed of the
Greek church resemble, in some respects, those
of the Roman Catholic, but it does not acknowledge
the Pope. Mr. Martyn was very kindly
entertained here, until the 17th, when he again set
out with servants and a guard, as the woods in Turkey,
on which they would soon enter, were much
beset with robbers. The route lay through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
deserted mountainous region, with an occasional
village, where the missionary was an object of
great curiosity. He seems to have enjoyed the
wild scenery, as much as a person travelling with
a company of ignorant and noisy companions could.
“The clear streams in the valley, the lofty trees
crowning the summit of the hills, the smooth
paths winding away and losing themselves in the
dark woods, and, above all, the solitude that reigned
throughout, composed a scene which tended to
harmonize and solemnize the mind. What displays
of taste and magnificence are found occasionally on
this ruined earth! Nothing was wanting but the
absence of the Turks.”</p>

<p>At a village, on the 29th, he was attacked with
fever and ague. He suffered the next day from
sickness and depression of spirits, but his soul
rested, as he said, “on Him who is as an anchor
of the soul, sure and steadfast, which, though not
seen, keeps me fast.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of October, “Marched over a mountainous
tract: we were out from seven in the morning
till eight at night. After sitting a little by the
fire, I was near fainting from sickness. My depression
of spirits led me to the throne of grace, as
a sinful, abject worm. When I thought of myself
and my transgressions, I could find no text so
cheering as, ‘My ways are not as your ways.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
From the men who accompanied Sir William
Ousely to Constantinople, I learned that the plague
was raging at Constantinople, and thousands dying
every day. One of the Persians had died of it.
They added, that the inhabitants of Tocat were
flying from their town from the same cause.
Thus I am passing inevitably into imminent danger.
O Lord, thy will be done! Living or dying,
remember me!”</p>

<p>The principal guard and leader of the party was
a Tartar, named Hassan Aga. His treatment of
Mr. Martyn from this time, was inhuman, and the
journal of the next five days gives a deeply affecting
narrative of the sufferings to which the savage
conduct of his guide exposed him.</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 2d.</em>—Some hours before day, I sent to
tell the Tartar I was ready, but Hassan Aga was
for once riveted to his bed. However, at eight,
having got strong horses, he set off at a great rate,
and over the level ground he made us gallop as fast
as the horses would go, to Chiflick, where we
arrived at sun-set. I was lodged, at my request,
in the stables of the post-house, not liking the
scrutinizing impudence of the fellows who frequent
the coffee room. As soon as it began to grow a
little cold, the ague came on, and then the fever:
after which I had a sleep, which let me know too
plainly the disorder of my frame. In the night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Hassan sent to summon me away, but I was quite
unable to move. Finding me still in bed at the
dawn, he began to storm furiously at my detaining
him so long; but I quietly let him spend his ire,
ate my breakfast composedly, and set out at eight.
He seemed determined to make up for the delay,
for we flew over hill and dale to Sherean, where
he changed horses. From thence we travelled all
the rest of the day and all night; it rained most
of the time. Soon after sun-set the ague came
on again, which, in my wet state, was very trying;
I hardly knew how to keep my life in me. About
that time there was a village at hand; but Hassan
had no mercy. At one in the morning we found
two men under a wain, with a good fire; they
could not keep the rain out, but their fire was
acceptable. I dried my lower extremities, allayed
the fever by drinking a good deal of water, and
went on. We had little rain, but the night was
pitchy dark, so that I could not see the road
under my horse’s feet. However, God being
mercifully pleased to alleviate my bodily suffering,
I went on contentedly to the next stage, where
we arrived at break of day. After sleeping three
or four hours, I was visited by an Armenian merchant,
for whom I had a letter. Hassan was in
great fear of being arrested here; the governor
of the city had vowed to make an example of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
for riding to death a horse belonging to a man
of this place. He begged that I would shelter
him in case of danger; his being claimed by an
Englishman, he said, would be a sufficient security.
I found, however, that I had no occasion to interfere.
He hurried me away from this place without
delay, and galloped furiously towards a village,
which, he said, was four hours distant; which was
all I could undertake in my present weak state;
but village after village did he pass, till night
coming on, and no signs of another, I suspected
that he was carrying me on to the next stage; so
I got off my horse, and sat upon the ground, and
told him, ‘I neither could nor would go any
further.’ He stormed, but I was immovable; till,
a light appearing at a distance, I mounted my
horse and made towards it, leaving him to follow
or not, as he pleased. He brought in the party,
but would not exert himself to get a place for
me. They brought me to an open verandah, but
Sergius<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> told them I wanted a place in which to be
alone. This seemed very offensive to them: ‘And
why must he be alone?’ they asked; ascribing
this desire of mine to pride, I suppose. Tempted,
at last, by money, they brought me to a stable-room,
and Hassan and a number of others planted
themselves there with me. My fever here increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
to a violent degree; the heat in my eyes and
forehead was so great, that the fire almost made
me frantic. I entreated that it might be put out,
or that I might be carried out of doors. Neither
was attended to: my servant, who, from my sitting
in that strange way on the ground, believed me
delirious, was deaf to all I said. At last I pushed
my head in among the luggage, and lodged it on
the damp ground, and slept.</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 5th.</em>—Preserving mercy made me see the
light of another morning. The sleep had refreshed
me, but I was feeble and shaken; yet the merciless
Hassan hurried me off. The stopping place, however,
not being distant, I reached it without much
difficulty. I expected to have found it another
strong fort at the end of the pass; but it is a poor
little village within the jaws of the mountains. I
was pretty well lodged, and felt tolerably well till
a little after sunset, when the ague came on with a
violence I had never before experienced; I felt as
if in a palsy: my teeth chattering, and my whole
frame violently shaken. Aga Hosyn and another
Persian, on their way here from Constantinople,
going to Abbas Mirza, whom I had just before
been visiting, came hastily to render me assistance
if they could. These Persians appear quite brotherly
after the Turks. While they pitied me,
Hassan sat in perfect indifference, ruminating on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the further delay this was likely to occasion. The
cold fit, after continuing two or three hours, was
followed by a fever, which lasted the whole night,
and prevented sleep.</p>

<p>“<em>Oct. 6th.</em>—No horses being to be had, I had
an unexpected repose. I sat in the orchard, and
thought, with sweet comfort and peace, of my God;
in solitude, my company, my friend and comforter.
Oh! when shall time give place to eternity! When
shall appear that new heaven and new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness! There, there shall in no
wise enter in any thing that defileth: none of that
wickedness which has made men worse than wild
beasts,—none of those corruptions which add still
more to the miseries of mortality, shall be seen or
heard of any more.”</p>

<p>These were the last words that Martyn wrote!
Nothing more is known of his fate than that he
reached the town of Tocat, in Turkey, nearly
six hundred miles from Tebriz, and about three
hundred from Constantinople, and that he died there
on the 16th of October, being in the thirty-second
year of his life. The plague was raging when he
arrived, and his sickness and fatigue made him
very liable to the disease; and his weakness was
such, that he could not long sustain it. No particulars
of his sickness and death have ever been
learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Two American missionaries, who passed through
Tocat in the year 1830, found his grave in an
Armenian burying-place, covered with a tombstone,
which had been erected by an English traveller,
the year after his interment. The only information
they could obtain was, that Mr. Martyn arrived
there sick, that some Armenians gave him medicine,
and that he died in four or five days. As hundreds
were dying daily of the plague, it was thought probable
that he was not admitted into any private
house, and that he died at the post-house. On the
tombstone is a Latin inscription, of which the following
is a translation:</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">
<span class="smcap">in memory of the<br>
rev. <span class="fs150">HENRY<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
 MARTYN</span>, of england,<br>
a minister of the gospel, and a missionary;<br>
a pious, learned, and faithful servant of<br>
the lord,<br>
who called him to a state of felicity,<br>
whilst at tocat, on his return to his<br>
native country, a. d. 1812.<br>
c. j. r. inscribed this stone to his memory,<br>
a. d. 1813.</span><br>
</p>

<p>There he died, alone, in a land of strangers, with
not a Christian to attend him. But there can be
no doubt that, if his reason was preserved, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
happy in that illness, that his faith in Christ enabled
him to bear his sufferings, and to expect with
joy a speedy admittance to the presence of his God
and Saviour.—To an unpardoned person it is incredible
that a Christian can have so strong an assurance
that his sins have been forgiven for Christ’s sake,
and that God has thus become reconciled to him,
as that he can be happy in the prospect of dying.
But it is certain that this is often the case, and that
Christians, even whilst suffering the most terrible
pain in their bodies, have felt a peace and joy in
the belief that they were near heaven, greater than
all the comforts of life have ever bestowed on them
or on others. Wherever the believer lives or dies,
Christ is with him. God is his Father, and he has
nothing to fear. It seems to us distressing, that
Martyn should die so far away from his home, and
his friends, in a nation of idolaters; but it is probable
these things did not affect him, and that the
dying missionary at Tocat was happier than he
would have been in health and peace, among his
friends in England. In his lonely journeys he
had often been able to quote the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In desert tracts, with Thee, my God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">How happy could I be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And he doubtless found Him still nearer in his
dying hour, when flesh and strength failed him;
for the Saviour adapts his consolations to the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
of his people, and in proportion to their
necessities, he imparts more of the gifts of his
Holy Spirit, and they are enabled to say, “Though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff comfort me.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Martyn left England for India, it was
his expectation and desire to be employed principally
in preaching to the natives. It is evident
that this was not the design of Providence, but that
he was sent to translate the scriptures into the languages
of Asia, that the gospel might thus be put
into the hands of millions of persons who were
wholly ignorant of the existence of a divine revelation.
Mr. Martyn in this way did more for the
evangelizing of all those nations who speak the
Hindoostanee, Arabic, and Persian, during the six
years that he was in India, than he could have accomplished
by preaching to them all his life. As
he himself observed of the Arabic alone, “we will
begin to preach to Arabia, Syria, Persia, Tartary
part of India and China, half of Africa, all the sea
coast of the Mediterranean, and Turkey, and one
tongue shall suffice for them all.” The Hindoostanee
and Persian are understood by a large portion
of the rest of India, who do not speak Arabic.</p>

<p>He has given them the Bible, and we cannot calculate
the amount of good which will attend its circulation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Without it all the labours of missionaries
would be in vain; but with it, they are sure
of the success which God has promised to attend
his own word. Besides the importance of his services
in this great means of preparing the way of
the Lord, his ministry was blessed to the conversion,
as there is every reason to believe, of several
of the natives. One of these was the fruit of his
labours in Cawnpore, and was baptized at Calcutta,
in the fortieth year of his age, by the name of Abdool
Messeeh—“servant of Christ.” He was
employed eight years by the Church Missionary
Society, to instruct the young in the principles of
the Christian religion, and was ordained as a Lutheran
minister in 1820, and as an Episcopal minister
by Bishop Heber, in 1825. He died in
1827. Through his instrumentality more than
forty adult Hindoos were brought to embrace
Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Another instance of the success of his ministry,
is furnished by a writer in a foreign journal, who
states that, on a visit to Shiraz several years since,
he met a Persian named Rahem, who gave him the
following account.</p>

<p>“There came to this city an Englishman, who
taught the religion of Christ, with a boldness hitherto
unparalleled in Persia, in the midst of much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
scorn and ill treatment from our moollahs, as well
as the rabble. He was a beardless youth, and evidently
enfeebled by disease. He dwelt among us
for more than a year. I was then a decided enemy
to infidels, as the Christians are termed by the followers
of Mohammed, and I visited this teacher of
the despised sect, with the declared object of treating
him with scorn, and exposing his doctrines to
contempt. Although I persevered for some time
in this behaviour towards him, I found that every
interview not only increased my respect for the individual,
but diminished my confidence in the faith
in which I was educated. His extreme forbearance
towards the violence of his opponents, the calm and
yet convincing manner in which he exposed the
fallacies and sophistries by which he was assailed,
(for he spoke Persian excellently,) gradually inclined
me to listen to his arguments, to inquire dispassionately
into the subject of them, and, finally, to
read a tract which he had written, in reply to a defence
of Islam by our chief moollahs. Need I
detain you longer? The result of my examination
was a conviction that the young disputant was
right. Shame, or rather fear, withheld me from
avowing this opinion; I even avoided the society
of the Christian teacher, though he remained in the
city so long. Just before he quitted Shiraz, I could
not refrain from paying him a farewell visit. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
conversation,—the memory of it will never fade
from the tablet of my mind,—sealed my conversion.
He gave me a book—it has ever been my constant
companion—the study of it has formed my most
delightful occupation—its contents have often consoled
me.”</p>

<p>“Upon this,” continues the writer, “he put into
my hands a copy of the New Testament, in
Persian; on one of the blank leaves it was written,—<em>There
is joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth</em>.—<span class="smcap">Henry Martyn.</span>”</p>

<p>In considering the life of Mr. Martyn as an example
to ourselves, we should view his devotedness
to the service of God. In this he stopped at no
sacrifices, but gave up his home, his prospects, his
health, that he might labour to promote the glory
of God, by bringing the heathen to acknowledge
him, and to receive the gospel of his blessed Son.
This he did willingly and cheerfully, because he
loved the service; and because, as he once said to a
Persian, he “could not endure existence, if Jesus
was not glorified.” Another motive was a desire
to bring men to salvation—to persuade them to
come to the Saviour, and learn the way of eternal
life. In all this, he was but discharging his duty
as a disciple of Christ; and especially as a minister
of the gospel, obeying the divine command, “Go
into all the world, and preach the gospel to every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
creature.” Now, every Christian will be anxious
to be actively employed in the service of his Redeemer.
He will not be satisfied with the belief
that he is saved, and continue to live, without
making any effort and any self-denials, to promote
the cause of Christianity. Indeed, such a feeling
is a strong evidence that he has never been the
subject of grace, that he has never felt the love of
God in Christ, and seen from the scriptures that
he is required to be active in his Saviour’s cause.
The Holy Spirit has declared, that as a tree is
known by its fruits, whether it be a good one or
not, so a true Christian is known by the service he
renders to God: and that an unprofitable servant,—a
professed disciple who does not improve the
opportunities which he has of doing good,—will be
rejected at the judgment day. The entire devotion
of ourselves, and all we have, to our Divine Master,
is required of every living being, as much
as it was of Henry Martyn: and although every
one is not called to be a missionary, yet every
one may find some field for active, zealous service.</p>

<p>Reader,—whether converted or unconverted,—have
you ever thought that you were <em>bound</em> to serve
God thus? have you ever believed that God has been
all your life <em>claiming</em> your service, as your creator,
your preserver, your eternal Father? If you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
not inclined to love and serve him, “with all your
heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind,”
ask yourself this moment why it is so, and what
excuse you will have to offer for your neglect,
when it shall be charged upon you at the day of
judgment. The commands of Christ, as has already
been remarked, are as binding on you, as
any of the commandments of the moral law; and
if you are not now an active, sincere disciple, living
by faith upon Him, and living to his glory, the
guilt of your natural sinfulness is awfully aggravated.</p>

<p>The zeal and devotion of Mr. Martyn were not
beyond his duty. There is no such thing as a man
being more holy, or doing more good than God requires
of him. Had he done tenfold more, he could
not have, on that account, procured the pardon of
a single sin. So let not the Christian think that
he deserves credit and praise for any thing he may
do, or that he thus gains a right to heaven. God
does, indeed, condescend to accept our services,
and to use us as instruments of doing good, but it
is he who gives us both the inclination and the
ability to serve him; therefore he deserves all the
praise. Not that this excuses us for being idle,
and waiting for him to compel us to be zealous for
him. Our duty is to pray, “Lord, what wilt thou
have us to do?” and at the same time to be seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
out ways of doing good. No person need be
idle or useless a moment, who has faculties, property,
or strength, which he can consecrate. Let
every one, then, fix upon something that will absorb
his attention, and resolve, with reliance upon
the grace of God, to expend every effort in accomplishing
it; not to be put back by small discouragements,
but to exercise <span class="smcap">strong faith in
Christ</span>. That is the principle which will enable
us to do every thing. Every Christian may say,
and ought to feel, “I can do all things through
Christ, who strengtheneth me.”</p>

<p>Thus let us act from the principles of love and
duty, and then we shall find that God has connected
our duty with our happiness, and that the more
we sacrifice for him—the more danger and reproach,
and hardships we may encounter, the
greater will be the peace and joy of our souls. In
infinite condescension, God speaks of <em>rewards</em> to
those who serve him. Oh, he would be just, after
all our labours, to cast us from his presence; but
he graciously promises to give his blessing to those
who strive to do his will, though they do it imperfectly.
And those who have humbly and zealously
applied themselves to the single purpose of
living for God, have found that he has given
them happiness beyond what they had conceived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
This internal bliss is comprehended in the assertion
of the apostle Paul, when he says, “eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
for those who love him; <em>but God hath revealed
them unto us by his Spirit</em>.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120">ABDOOL MESSEEH.</p>

<p>The following interesting history of this convert
is given in a Report of the Church Missionary
Society:</p>

<p>“He was born at Delhi. His original name was
Shekh Salih. His father is considered a learned
man, and gains a livelihood by teaching children.
Shekh Salih was instructed by his father, and made
considerable proficiency both in the Persian and
Arabic languages.</p>

<p>“When he was about twenty-one years of age,
he came with his father to Lukhnow, in quest
of employment; and after some time, became
moonshee, first to an English merchant, and then
to an officer in the East India Company’s service.
At this time Abdool was so zealous a
Mussulman, that he induced a Hindoo servant of
the above officer to become a Mohammedan. The
master finding some fault with him for his officiousness,
he was so offended as to leave his
employ, and return to Lukhnow, with a determination
of having no more communication with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the British. After this he engaged in a variety
of pursuits, and visited different parts of the
country, being always very attentive, and endeavouring
to render others so, to the Mohammedan
observances.</p>

<p>“At length, after having been about a year in
some situation under the Nabob of Lukhnow, he
went into the Mahratta country, and engaged as a
trooper in the service of Ibrahim Ali Khan, one of
the chieftains of the Javudpore Rajah. While under
the command of this chief, Meer Khan, another
chieftain, at that time in the service of the same
Rajah, was sent to murder Rao Scivac Sing, the
rival of the Javudpore Rajah. This transaction is
well known in India. Meer Khan swore on the
Koran, that he came to mediate a peace between
his employer and the Rao, whom he no sooner decoyed
into his tent, than, having gone out on some
pretence, he caused the cords of it to be cut, and
ordered his attendants to stab the visiters involved
in its folds. The ill-fated Rao cut his way through
the folds of the tent with a dagger, and bravely defended
himself until overpowered by numbers; his
head was severed from his body, and after being
carried about in triumph, was sent to the Rajah.
This Scivac Sing, Abdool relates, was a young
man of very interesting appearance; and pity for
his untimely death, with the horror excited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
sight of his head, exposed as a spectacle, raised a
feeling of disgust at the perfidy of mankind. Abdool
had hitherto been a stranger to such treachery;
and considering, as he says, that he himself was
liable to be made the executioner of equally inhuman
measures, he resolved on quitting the army,
and earning his bread in some peaceful way, by
any labour, however degrading. This determination
he put in practice; and returning to Lukhnow,
supported himself by preparing green paint.</p>

<p>“At the end of about a year, Abdool went to
Cawnpore to visit his father, at that time engaged
as private tutor in the house of a rich native, who
lived in the premises next to those of the Rev. Henry
Martyn. He here heard of Mr. Martyn’s preaching
to the poor natives, who assembled on the lawn before
his house on Sundays. He determined to go,
as he expressed it, to see the sport. Mr. Martyn
was explaining the commandments to the people,
when Abdool went to hear; and he was struck
with the observations that were made, and considered
them as both reasonable and excellent. He
had previously been perplexed about the contradictions
maintained by the different Mohammedan
sects, and this Christian instruction appeared to
him better than any he had as yet received. He
told his father what opinion he had formed, and
begged him to get him some employment at Cawnpore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
where he might hear of more of these things.
His father was acquainted with a friend of Sabat,
who was then living with Mr. Martyn; and through
this friend, Abdool was engaged, in May 1810, to
copy Persian writings for Sabat. He obtained a
lodging on the premises, without making known
his wishes. Here he had many opportunities of
obtaining the information which he desired, particularly
by inquiring of the native Christian children
the subjects of the lessons which they had
learned in school: and by this mode, he was
enabled to gain some insight into Divine Truth.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Martyn had finished his translation
of the New Testament into Hindoostanee, the book
was given Abdool to bind. This he considered as
a fine opportunity; nor did he let it slip. On reading
the word of God, he discovered his state, and
perceived therein a true description of his own
heart. He soon decided in favour of the Christian
religion; but still concealed what was passing
within him, till Mr. Martyn being about to leave
Cawnpore on account of his health, Abdool could
no longer refrain from asking his advice with respect
to his future conduct; earnestly desiring at
the same time, to be baptized. It was agreed that
he should go down to Calcutta with Sabat and Mr.
Martyn, from whom he received a solemn warning
of the danger of a false profession. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
short period of Mr. Martyn’s stay at Calcutta, he
was not entirely convinced of this man’s real
change of heart: recommending him, therefore, to
the notice of the late Rev. David Brown, he departed
without gratifying Abdool’s wish for baptism.
After five month’s further delay, Mr. Brown,
having observed his conduct, and being satisfied
with it, baptized him in the old church, on Whit-Sunday,
1811.</p>

<p>“On this occasion, Mr. Brown wrote to a friend:
‘On Sunday last, I publicly baptized Shekh Salih.
It was a most solemn and heart-affecting occasion.
Private notice was given, that it would be in the
afternoon. Good people of all ranks attended, and
in the evening, I preached on the subject. This
has made a very serious impression at Calcutta. I
have had great satisfaction in the event. The circumstances
of his case were remarkable. May
we every Whit-Sunday witness similar wonders
of grace! I made full investigation, and was
thoroughly satisfied with the Shekh’s account
of his conversion. His Christian name is Abdool
Messeeh,—‘<em>Servant of Christ</em>;’ a particular
circumstance leading to the selection of that
name.’</p>

<p>“From this period, he was noticed by some
among Mr. Brown’s congregation, and gained from
their instruction a growing acquaintance with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
own fallen state, and the remedy provided for it
through the Saviour.</p>

<p>“From Whit-Sunday 1811, till last July, Abdool
continued to reside in Calcutta. Much opposition
he met with from the Mohammedans, who made
him many offers of money, &amp;c., if he would renounce
Christianity, or leave the place. Twice,
on frivolous pretences, he was summoned before
the British magistrate, and discharged with costs.
Under these circumstances, his temper has appeared
to great advantage, and invariably, such as one
should have wished. To put an end to these vexations,
he was advised to remove to Chinsurah in
July; where his conversation and example produced
a good effect on many, especially on a Roman
Catholic Portuguese, and the son of an Armenian
priest, who have both expressed an intention of
following him up the country, that they may enjoy
his company, and partake of his labours.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Corrie accompanied Abdool on a
missionary tour in India; and from the journal
which he kept, the following extracts are made.
Whilst this narrative gives evidence of the zeal and
piety of the individual, and thus exemplifies the
power of religion, it is interesting as a specimen of
the method which missionaries have to pursue in Pagan
countries, and as proof of the great importance
of having native converts employed in this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“<em>1812, Nov. 20th.</em>—We left the neighbourhood
of Calcutta, having two friends in company. There
was a large party of boatmen and servants.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nov. 29th.</em>—We rested in a lonely place. In
the afternoon, Abdool collected the boatmen and
others on the bank, to the number of about forty,
and preached to them. He began and ended with
a hymn, after the manner of the Asiatic religious,
in which he was joined by the Christian children
and servants. His discourse was from the latter
end of the first chapter of St. Matthew. He spoke
of our sinful state by nature, adducing many proofs
observable in their own life and conversation,
which render a Saviour necessary; enlarged on
the birth of Christ without sin, that he might be a
suitable surety for sinners; the meaning of his
name Jesus, Immanuel; bringing forward proofs
of his divine power, and pointing out the salvation
which he bestows. The latter part was very satisfactory
indeed, as an evidence of his acquaintance
with the change which passes in the Christian’s
mind. His discourse was intermixed with exhortations
to embrace the religion of the only Saviour.
Some, it seems, set light by what they heard:
others approved, and said his book contained more
weighty truths than their Shasters.”</p>

<p>“<em>Dec. 5th.</em>—Saturday. We arrived in the neighbourhood
of a Christian friend, and our party went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
from the boats to pass the Sunday at his house
and found, literally, in the wilderness God present
in our little assembly.</p>

<p>“Abdool could not get the boatmen to attend
him; and therefore, taking the Christian children
with him, he went to a village at a little distance,
and began to sing his hymn. The whole village,
men, women, and children, soon gathered round
him; he explained to them the ten commandments,
and enforced their obligation. They heard with
much attention.”</p>

<p>“<em>Dec. 29th.</em>—At Dinapore we were gratified
with the sight of a large school of native children,
kept by the Baptist missionaries. They have
another school in a neighbouring village. One of
the missionaries told me, that Mr. Martyn’s name
is held in great esteem by the natives here; and
that the schools which he had instituted when here,
had rendered the way easier; for the people now
send their children to school without scruple. I remember
it was not so when Mr. Martyn began his
schools.”</p>

<p>“<em>1813, Jan. 3.</em>—Sunday. Our boat staid at Ribbon
Gunge. In the afternoon, Abdool went into
the bazar, and preached. At first, the people
showed no attention; but gradually, one and another
stood, till a crowd collected, and more attention
seemed excited than at any place before. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
he had finished his discourse, the people gathered
round him, and asked many questions about the
names which he had mentioned. Three came
down to his boat with him, and passed a good deal
of the evening in conversation; writing down from
his lips what he told them in brief of Christian
truth.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 7th.</em>—At Baxar. Early in the morning
walked with Abdool toward the European barracks.
On drawing near, some of the native wives of the
soldiers recognized me, and several came out and
expressed their gladness to see me, and said they
should be happy to have public worship. These
had been of my congregation at Chunar. Abdool
expressed great satisfaction, and observed that this
was the first time he had seen native Christians
desire divine service. About ten, we had public
worship with the Europeans, the commanding officer
attending. About twenty native Christians,
mostly women, assembled in another place, with
Abdool; after reading prayers, he was led to discourse
long on subjects which occurred at the time,
and says he never felt his heart so drawn out
during any exercise as here. Several, also, of the
congregation were affected, even to tears.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 10th.</em>—Sunday. Rested at Ghazeepore.
In the afternoon, Abdool walked into the native
town. Met with the chief land-owner in the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
and neighbourhood; a man of wealth and of great
good nature, and much esteemed among his own
people, as a holy man. After some conversation,
he invited Abdool to his house, where about a
hundred people were assembled, before whom
much discussion took place about religion. The
above person showed more disposition to attend
than any of them; and begged to have two
copies of St. Matthew, and two of Persian, and
that all the translations should be sent him from
time to time.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 14th.</em>—We reached Benares. On Friday,
Abdool went up to Secrole, to visit a native doctor
there, of Portuguese origin. They had much conversation
together, with which the above person
expressed himself greatly delighted. He thankfully
accepted a copy of the morning prayer and
litany, promising to begin worship in his family.
Abdool visited other native Christians there, with
less satisfaction. In returning to his boat, he had
a long discussion with a crowd of Mussulmans.</p>

<p>“On Saturday, Abdool went to Chunar; and on
Sunday forenoon, held public worship there. On
that, but few attended; but those were greatly affected;
many of them even to loud sobbing and
tears. They earnestly requested that he would
preach again the next day, which he did to a large
assembly; and on Tuesday also. They heard with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
great attention, and detained him long afterwards
with inquiries on the subject on which he had addressed
them. A party came down to his boat,
begging he would read the scriptures to them;
and adding, ‘Alas! when master was here,’ (meaning
Mr. Corrie, who had been chaplain at Chunar,)
‘we paid too little attention to his labours. Would
you were to remain among us!’”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 22.</em>—At Mirzapore, a young man came
on board, who said he had followed from Chunar,
on purpose to hear more from Abdool, and to beg
a copy of the translation. He is the son of a Zemindar,
and appears serious, and full of inquiries.
He said he knew, that in the latter days, all shall
become of one religion; and he supposed the time
to be at hand.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jan. 23.</em>—In the morning we arrived at Allahabad.</p>

<p>“The concourse of people assembled to celebrate
the annual bathing season, was unusually
great. Every one that bathes at the junction of
the Ganges and Jumma, pays to government a rupee;
and from a calculation made two days before
the close of the festival, it was expected that 250,000
rupees would be collected. Those who drown
themselves pay an additional sum to government.
One poor wretch had drowned himself, with the
usual ceremonies, before our arrival. Several more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
had signified their intention of doing so, at the
eclipse of the sun, on February 1; and many, it
was expected, as is annually the case, would, from
the pressure of the crowd, be thrust beyond their
depth, and perish in the waters. The sight of such
a multitude, collected on so deplorable an occasion,
could not but affect a feeling mind. And is not the
error of Balaam chargeable on those, who, possessing
the vision of the Almighty, love and receive the
wages of such superstitious iniquity?”</p>

<p>“In going to the house of a merchant, Abdool
passed by a mosque, where they were beginning
prayers. He went to the door, but did not go in,
lest they should raise a complaint against him for
defiling their place. The reader began: ‘O God,
enlighten our hearts with the light of faith!’ Abdool
said aloud, ‘Amen!’ The reader looked
round with astonishment; and after observing, began
again the same sentence; to which Abdool
again repeated aloud, ‘Amen!’ The reader proceeded,
and Abdool was silent the rest of the service.
When it was ended, some of them came
round him, and inquired, ‘You said Amen to the
first sentence, but to no other; why was this?’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em> ‘Because the first sentence was right,
and was the prayer of holy men of old; but the
latter part is an invention of late date.’</p>

<p>“<em>Query.</em>—‘How do you make that appear?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘You add the name of Aububeckar to
that of Mohammed so that, by your own confession,
that is added since Mohammed’s time.’</p>

<p>“Some of them now suspected, and inquired if
he were not such an one. This led to an understanding,
and a long dispute, in which he explained
to them many of our customs in worship, and
made appeals to their conscience. One asked, if
he were not affected by the contempt of his former
friends, and wondered he could be so hardened as
thus openly to contend for Christianity.</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘I am, indeed, affected; and my heart
by no means approves of your opposition; and you
know, that at Lukhnow, had such things been said
to me, how I should have resisted; but now I am
withheld. I am no longer in my own keeping, but
in the power of another.’</p>

<p>“These asked who that might be. He answered,
‘I am restrained, and enabled to bear your
reproach, by the power of the Holy Spirit.’ They
were silent.</p>

<p>“He went last to the old merchant, who has a
house at Delhi, where he formerly resided, and
with some of whose children Abdool was educated.
He treated Abdool with more affection than any of
the others: and was much moved by his exhortations
to seek salvation from Christ, at the eleventh
hour. He, and two others of the whole crowd assembled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
took a copy of St. Matthew’s Gospel.
Many might have been given away; but where no
disposition appeared to read them, it was thought
best not to give them.</p>

<p>“In one company, Abdool had occasion to mention
his having been baptized by Mr. Brown.
Some one inquired, ‘Where is Mr. Brown now?’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘He is where he has long intended to
go. He is no longer in this world.’ They said,
‘That is very well! May you soon go after him,
and no longer make this ado about your religion!’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘I do, indeed, desire to be where Mr.
Brown is, and care not how soon I may be taken:
but think not this religion depends on Mr. Brown,
or on me: for if I were taken away, God can raise
up one from among your own selves, to supply my
place.’”</p>

<p>“<em>Feb. 5th.</em>—An event occurred to-day, which
Abdool related with great pleasure. At Monickpore
resides an aged man, of venerable appearance,
with a flowing white beard, who is considered a
holy man. He is the proprietor of several villages,
and is a man of more than ordinary good nature.
He has many servants, and many disciples, and
keeps open house for travellers. On these accounts
he is much venerated by his neighbours. His place
of worship is held very sacred, and many go
thither as on a kind of pilgrimage. On Abdool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
looking in at the outer gate of the premises, one
who was going in said, ‘Come in, and pay your
devotions.’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘What place is this?’</p>

<p>“‘It is a holy place; come in.’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘What advantage will arise from my
going in?’</p>

<p>“<em>Stranger.</em>—‘Why, every body goes.’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Though every body should act senselessly,
why should I?’</p>

<p>“On this the old man came out, and asked Abdool
who he was?</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘I am one of mankind, a servant of
God.’</p>

<p>“The master of the house pressed him to go in;
and ordered food to be brought for him, and for a
Christian lad who was with him. On the food being
brought, he himself set it before them, and
begged them to eat.</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Excuse me; I may not eat of your
dishes: not that I have any objection to eat with
you, or with any one: but I am a Christian; and
should I eat with you, your disciples would say
you had lost caste.’</p>

<p>“‘You are, at all events, a good man, for thus
explaining to me, and I am happy to see you.
Pray, have the English any books beside histories
and books of amusement?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Yes, surely; they have the books of
Moses, of the Prophets, and the Gospel. All the
ancient books are in their possession.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes! the law, the psalms, the gospel, and
the koran. I know there are four divine books.’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Well! all these are in the hands of
the English; though of these there are many books
which you include under the name of the law;’
mentioning Isaiah and Daniel, and saying that David
was the author of the Psalms.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘I never knew that
before; and have the English any kind of worship
among them?’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Certainly they have: but they are
taught to shut their door, and to pray to their
Father who seeth in secret. They place no dependence
on outward observances for salvation.
Why, if you are to be judged according to your
opinions, by your works, you must be condemned.
You are required to have on clean clothes when
you worship; and that is easily obeyed: but then
you are also to exclude the world from your mind,
and to worship with the heart intensely fixed on
God, (repeating a verse of the koran in proof.)
Now, do you thus fulfil the precept?’</p>

<p>“The old man said, ‘Oh no!’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Then are you not an offender?’</p>

<p>“‘Alas! yes.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘Now the Christians are taught to believe
in Jesus, as enduring the shame and pain of
death, on the cross, which they deserve; and that,
through faith in his sufferings, they shall be saved.
They do indeed obey God; yet not of themselves,
but by his grace: and their obedience attends their
salvation, though not as the price of it.’</p>

<p>“The old man expressed great thankfulness;
said he had never heard such things before; told
his disciples these were true words, and begged a
copy of the Gospel: for which, as Abdool had not
taken one with him, he walked down, attended by
his retinue. On parting, he begged Abdool would
give him a sentence to remember. This is a custom
between spiritual guides, when they part after
a visit; and the most absurd expressions are common
among them on these occasions. Abdool said,
‘There is no such custom among Christians; but
I can tell you one sentence, which, if you remember
and believe, may be of service to you; and that
is, ‘The blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
cleanseth from all sin!’ He requested Abdool
would write to him, from time to time, on such
subjects.</p>

<p>“<em>Feb. 13th.</em>—Saturday, arrived at Cawnpore.
On Sunday, Abdool’s brother, and his nephew,
came from Lukhnow to meet him. They received
him with great affection, and wished to eat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
him, and to be one with him in all things. Abdool
wisely would not suffer them, until they should
understand the grounds of his conversion, when
they might choose. They brought word that a
great stir had been made in Lukhnow, on the report
of his baptism reaching that place. One night
a crowd collected at his father’s house, and demanded
that he should openly renounce his apostate
son, or they should suspect him also of becoming
a Christian. He and the brothers declared they
would not renounce Abdool, who always behaved
kindly, and now wrote to them with great affection.
A tumult ensued, which required the interference
of the cutwal, or mayor; and the report was carried
to the Nabob’s sons, if not to the Nabob himself.
The great men took the part of Abdool’s
family, and threatened the other party. These
circumstances were partly known; and it had been
determined as most advisable for Abdool, not to go
to Lukhnow for the present; but on being told of
his family’s continued good will and favourable
disposition to the gospel, as also that his father,
mother, brothers, and sisters, with their children,
had determined on coming to see him, if he would
not go over—the sisters also resolving to risk the
displeasure of their husbands rather than not see
him—Abdool thought he ought to go; and we,
commending him to the Lord, sent him, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
brother and nephew, with one servant to bring us
word of his welfare.</p>

<p>“Abdool is well known here, and his return has
excited much talk about religion. It would occupy
too much time to record every part of the conversation
which he held the first day he went to the
Bazar. It would explain exactly what is recorded
of St. Paul’s disputing daily in the market. Acts
xvii. 17.</p>

<p>“One circumstance seems worthy to be remembered,
as it shows that the natives are well aware
that Christianity requires diligence in business. A
Faqueer by trade, on seeing Abdool, cried out,
‘Ho! you seller of (your) faith, will you give me
any thing?’</p>

<p>“<em>Abd.</em>—‘If you desire to purchase spiritual
blessings, I may, perhaps, be able to supply you;
but, as to worldly things, I have little to give.
What I have, I labour for, and you are able to work
for your provision, as well as I.’</p>

<p>“The Faqueer replied, ‘So I expected; now
you are become English, you would be for setting
me to work.—I know their way is, work for your
bread! work for your bread!’</p>

<p>“On the evening of Sunday the 21st, we were
agreeably surprised by the return of Abdool from
Lukhnow. He found the ill-will of his former
friends so much excited, that he did not leave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
father’s house, during the day he staid there. In
the evening he went to a friend’s house, and had
much discussion on the subject of religion. He
gave ten copies of St. Matthew to different persons
who desired them, and prudently withdrew privately;
and praised God, he says, when he set foot on
British territory.</p>

<p>“Two days after his return, his father, two brothers,
and two nephews, came over. Their prejudices
appear removed. They joined in prayer,
both in private and in church, and declared their
intention of embracing Christianity. Most of their
inquiries were on the subject of our Lord’s divinity,
of which, after having seen the evidences from
the Old and New Testaments, they seemed convinced.
Their parting with Abdool was very affecting.
The old man threw his arms round his
son’s neck, and wept plentifully. Abdool was
much moved, and said, ‘I pray, sir, forbear your
tears. My Lord hath said, He that loveth brother,
or sister, or father, or mother, more than me, is
not worthy of me.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, well,’ said the old man; ‘but I am returning
to calamity; I know many will try to
trouble me; but I will give up these,’ turning to
his two grand-children, ‘to be educated in Christianity;
I commit them to Jesus Christ! God grant
that that country (Lukhnow) may soon come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
the possession of the British! Then we might
live in peace.’ Abdool reminded him, that God
would deliver him, and that His peace is alone
worth caring for. ‘True,’ said the younger brother,
‘and these lads we commit to Christ! During
the rains I also will come and stay some months
with you.’”</p>

<p>“<em>March 18th, 1813.</em>—Arrived at Agra. Abdool
had come on some days before, and related several
conversations with persons on the way, about religion.
Many copies of St. Matthew given away.</p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, March 21.</em>—About three P.M. six
native Christians, beside the children, &amp;c. attended
Hindoostanee worship in the fort, with whom Abdool
read prayers, and expounded Luke v., it being
the chapter in order of reading. In the evening
many hundreds of the poor assembled near the fort,
to whom Abdool read and explained briefly the ten
commandments. Many cried out, ‘These are true
words; and the curse of God will be upon us if
we obey them not!’</p>

<p>“<em>March 22.</em>—Set our native school in order, by
appointing six of the head boys to learn English
on the new British plan, that some or all of them
might, through the divine blessing, become translators.
They all continue to learn the catechism
in the mornings, with Persian during the day; and
attend morning and evening worship, in which Abdool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
officiates, by reading a chapter, and making
remarks upon it, using some prayers from the liturgy
afterward.</p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, March 28th.</em>—At three o’clock, the
native congregation of Christians consisted of about
forty persons. Abdool explained the Gospel of St.
Luke in order, and read and commented on the
fourteenth chapter. Some of the people staid to
inquire who he was, and said they felt their hearts
much affected whilst he was addressing them. In
the evening he went into the town. A great crowd
collected to receive charity. Before he distributed it,
he explained the original state and the fall of man.
Many sat quietly; evidently more taken up with
the discourse, than with their own necessities.
Daily some of the Mohammedans come to converse
with Abdool.</p>

<p>“<em>April 3.</em>—This evening he went to visit a very
old man, accounted by the Mohammedans a holy
man, and resorted to by many of them. He had been
a scholar of Abdool’s grandfather, and had repeatedly
expressed a desire to see Abdool. Many were
collected at the old man’s house. Some asked, who
Abdool was. The old man told them, mentioning
many circumstances respecting the respectability
of his family: among others, that Abdool’s mother’s
brother, is president of the Royal Mohammedan
College at Delhi. They then asked Adbool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
whence he now came; and on being told that he
was a certain Englishman’s disciple, they inquired
what he had learnt. He replied, he had gained
some valuable information in religion. One of
them said, ‘What connexion has religion with the
English? Their native country is a small island,
where they can know nothing; and in this country,
what benefit in religion can you reap from them?’
Abdool told him, that he spoke thus, for want of
information. The old man made a sign for Abdool
to desist. Abdool said, ‘If you are afraid I should
be disgraced before this company, pray understand
that I go into the Bazar to speak on these subjects,
and am not ashamed of Christianity, that I should
flatter, or deal in ambiguous language.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘but now leave off,
and come among us from time to time; we shall
be happy to see you.’</p>

<p>“The discussion was thus interrupted, and nothing
satisfactory could afterward be introduced;
so Abdool rose to go. They again invited him to
frequent their society; he replied, he had not time
to spare for mere visiting; but if they would allow
him to read a chapter in the gospel every time he
came, he would wait on them as often as they
pleased. They expressed a wish that this might
be the case. Time will prove their sincerity.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, April 4th.</em>—In the afternoon, at three,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
fewer native Christians attended Hindoostanee worship;
but a great many servants of the gentlemen
who live in the fort, came to hear, behaved very
orderly, and heard with much attention the explanation
of the parable of the prodigal son. In the
evening Abdool explained the Apostle’s creed, to
multitudes of natives, collected outside the fort,
who all behaved respectfully to him.</p>

<p>“<em>April 5th.</em>—After morning worship Abdool
took the children, and went into the fort, to be
ready for the afternoon. When all the children
were collected, he read to them the story of ‘Henry
and his Bearer.’ They all expressed great
delight. When he had finished, the eldest of
his nephews said, ‘Now I must of necessity be
baptized.’</p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, April 11th.</em>—About nine o’clock,
while the native Christian children and servants
were at worship, a venerable old man, who says he is
ninety years of age, came from the Tage to Abdool’s.
The tears began to roll down his cheeks, as they
proceeded in the service: toward the end, he repeated
‘Amen’ heartily, after each petition. When
prayers were ended, he went up to Abdool, and
embraced him; who said, ‘Do you know that I
am a Christian?’ He answered, ‘Yes: I heard
so yesterday. I have often seen the English at
worship, but never understood their language; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
your prayers are most excellent, and my soul has
been greatly refreshed by them.’</p>

<p>“<em>May 5th.</em>—To-day a Mohammedan physician
sent to request that Abdool would visit him in the
evening. He accordingly went, and found him as
an attendant on the Royal Family at Jondpore. He
has leave to visit Agra, owing to sickness in his
family, which required change of air. He had
heard of Abdool’s conversion yesterday, and could
not believe he was the person he pretended to be.
He offered to bet 2000 rupees, that a person of the
family described, could not change his religion.
He moreover said, if he were such a one, he must
know him, for they were at school together; and
he would send for this person, (viz. Abdool Messeeh,)
and prove him to be an impostor. On Abdool’s
going to his house, nothing could exceed the
physician’s astonishment, to find him the very person
described, and his own school-fellow. They
had a long and friendly conversation about their
former intercourse, and read several chapters in St.
Matthew, and other parts of the New Testament.
On Abdool’s answering his objections, he said,
‘This is the way I understand you did yesterday,
silencing every body by reference to their own customs:
and so I perceive Islam will not stand.’ He
took a copy of St. Matthew, and desired to have
the whole New Testament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, May, 9th.</em>—In the evening, out of
the fort, a greater number than ever was collected,
with evident desire to hear the Word. They checked
one another, in order to preserve silence. One,
impatient at the noise around him, cried aloud,
‘Keep silence, ye accursed, and let us hear the
Word! Ye have six days in the week, have ye
not, to babble and talk?’ The subject was, ‘<em>This
is a faithful saying</em>.’ Several were in tears. One
man came forward, and declared he would be a
Christian. He was sick, had long been ill, did not
expect to live long, and these words comforted
him. He had never before heard such comfortable
words.</p>

<p>“One evening, during the preceding week, Abdool
went into the city. A number of people collected
round him, and entered into conversation; at
length, they begged that he would sit down, and
read them a chapter. He did so, and read the
eleventh of John. One of them told him, ‘if you
would have us become Christians, you must come
among us, and teach us the gospel. Come and live
among us, and we will attend you daily.’</p>

<p>“<em>Sunday, June 6th.</em>—The attendance in the
fort was as usual; and in the evening, without the
fort, the crowd was beyond all former example.
Even the tops of some of the houses, were covered
with Mohammedans; but those of the crowd who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
could not hear, by their pressing and eagerness to
get forward, prevented much of what Abdool said
from being heard.</p>

<p>“<em>June 7th.</em>—The whole day was passed by
Abdool in the city; and his house was like an exchange,
from morning till night. More copies of
the scriptures were sought for; and one moonshee
began to read St. Matthew with Abdool. Three
children were brought to school, and the people
speak with much admiration of the establishment
of a free school.</p>

<p>“<em>June 9th.</em>—Numbers of people visited Abdool
again to-day, and many interesting conversations
took place. An old Mohammedan, uncle to one
of the principal men in the city, was asked, on going
away, what he thought of Abdool. He answered,
‘What can I say? He says nothing amiss;
and nothing can be objected to the Gospel; what
can I say?’</p>

<p>“<em>June 10th.</em>—To-day the doctrine of Christ
witnessed a triumph. For three weeks past, a faqueer,
of the Jogi tribe, has come frequently to our
morning worship, in the school. On Tuesday the
chapter to be read in order was John xvii. The
subject of it, and our Lord’s manner toward his
disciples, arrested the attention of the Jogi, and the
tears flowed plentifully down his cheeks. To-day
he brought his wife and child; said he was a convert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
to Jesus, without reserve; and began of himself
to take off his Faqueer’s dress. He first took
the beads from off his neck; then broke the string
to which the charm given him by his gooroo was
suspended; then broke off an iron ring worn round
his waist, and to which an iron rod, about two feet
long, was attached. He then put on some old
clothes, which we had by us, and said, now he
wished to be instructed in the Gospel, and to get
employment. A rupee was given to procure food
for the family, with which the wife went and
bought a spinning wheel, saying, she would spin
and earn their livelihood. These are wonders in
the history of a Hindoo. The whole family afterward
ate their dinner with Abdool, of their own
accord.</p>

<p>“To-day, also, an old woman who has constantly
heard Abdool on Sundays, brought her little all
from the house of a Mohammedan, where she had
long lived, and took up her abode among the Christians,
expressing a heart-affecting sense of her value
for the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>“A leper too, who has spent years in religious
observances, without finding rest to his mind, and
who has been some time in constant attendance on
the means of grace, took up his abode with us,
saying, Jesus would cure the inward leprosy of his
soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“The old soldier also, and his wife and son,
have cast in their lot with us.</p>

<p>“The school to-day increased to ten, expressly
under the idea that it is a Christian institution.</p>

<p>“<em>June 12th.</em>—The whole city seems moved
with this new thing which is come unto them; but
not a tongue stirs in opposition. As a proof of
this, the Mooftee of the court, whose father is Khazee
ol Kazat, or Native Chief Justice of the Company’s
head court in Calcutta, sent to beg that
Abdool would forget the attempt that had been made
by his relatives in Calcutta, to procure his imprisonment,
and would visit him, (the Mooftee,) and
be friends with him.</p>

<p>“It would be no easy task to record all the interesting
discussions which have taken place, during
these two days, between Abdool and the principal
Mohammedans in the city. One of them observed,
that Abdool was so provided with armour, that
none of their weapons (arguments) could reach
him.</p>

<p>“<em>June 18th.</em>—To-day, Abdool was informed,
that the kazee (judge) is taking pains to prevent
the children from coming to school, and the people
from visiting him. Some of the children said to
him, on his forbidding them to go to school to
Abdool, ‘Will you then instruct us gratis, as he
does?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“<em>June 25th.</em>—Yesterday, as Abdool was reading
and explaining Acts iv. at his house in the city,
an extraordinary instance of Divine power attending
the Word, appeared. A youth about fifteen, a
Brahmin of the Gour caste, had come, among
others, to see and hear this new thing. Abdool
observed him very attentive; and as he proceeded,
and was explaining verse 12, ‘Neither is there salvation
in any other, for there is none other name
given among men, whereby we can be saved,’ the
lad seemed greatly agitated, and breaking off his
Brahmin’s cord, threw it away. All who were
present observed what he did, but no notice was
then taken. After the congregation went away, the
lad remained; said he would embrace the Christian
religion, and, in short, of his own accord ate with
Abdool, and came home with him in the evening.”</p>

<p>“<em>July 6th.</em>—To-day the Rajah Ram Narian
passed most of the day here. He is son of the
brother of the well known Cheyt Sing, Rajah of
Benares, who was finally set aside from the rajahship
by the Honourable Company, on the murder
of Mr. Cherry, and the present family placed on
the musnud, who are of the female line. On June
9th, this Rajah Ram Narian called upon me, (Rev.
Mr. Corrie.) He had passed the greatest part of
a day at Cawnpore, with the late Mr. Martyn,
with whom I was then an inmate. Since then, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
has been visiting about among the Mahratta princes
and on arriving here, and hearing of my being here
he came to call upon me. After some time, he entered
into a detail of the misfortunes of his family.
I heard him out, and then endeavoured to show
him, that all worldly expectations were thus deluding;
and that, though we should gain our end
in the world, we must leave it, and go to give account
to God: whilst those, who know and love
the true God, have a never-failing portion. Abdool,
who was present, took up the subject. The young
man was roused to attention, came to see us day
after day, and expressed very freely in public his
approbation of the Gospel, becoming daily more
serious and earnest in his religious inquiries. At
length, he became suspected of an inclination to
Christianity. Crowds, both of Hindoos and Mussulmans,
visited him daily, to dissuade him from
associating with Abdool. On the 2d inst., he took
up his abode with Abdool, in the city; and now,
the whole city seemed moved. Day and night, he
was beset by people, many of whom had never
seen him, or heard of him until now; and the agitation
of mind occasioned thereby, made him quite
unwell. To-day he is much indisposed, yet came
out to see me. After some previous conversation,
I said to him, ‘If your intention of embracing
Christianity be sincere, I do most heartily invite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
you to occupy these rooms,’ in which we were sitting,
‘and in all respects, to consider me as a brother:
only I am anxious that no worldly motive
should enter into your resolutions, and that no one
should be able to say, you were influenced by temporal
considerations.’ He answered, very distinctly
and deliberately, ‘Sir, in respect of name, what
can I propose to myself by the change? My family
is the chief among the Hindoos, being Brahmins,
and lords of the holy city. In respect to provision,
you know how I have lived, and could still live:’—he
told me before, that he could collect 400 rupees
a month, and subsistence for three or four
hundred followers among the Mahratta princes:—‘What
earthly end can I have in view? But,
among the Hindoos or Mohammedans, I never
heard of any whose birth, life, death, resurrection,
and ascension, can be compared with Jesus. I perceive
he is the only Saviour, and I see I may obtain
remission of sins through him.’</p>

<p>“<em>July 8th.</em>—In consequence of the above visit,
the friends and adherents of the Rajah became quite
violent with him, and threatened, by some means
or other, to put an end to his life. They threatened
Abdool also, who quietly, but resolutely answered,
‘If you should accomplish my death, it
would be a cause of joy to me, as bringing me at
once to Him whose I am; but, be assured, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
lives would be forfeited to the law, and at the
throne of God, you would find Raim,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or any other
you depend upon, quite unable to save you from
the guilt of murder.’ They were dismayed at his
resolution, and have kept aloof from him since;
but have persuaded the Rajah to make a journey to
Gualier, where another widow of Cheyt Sing’s is,
and of a brother of his own. He says he will come
back alone shortly; appears in deep distress; and
said to-day, ‘I go with them because I fear they
will otherwise murder me; but I know, if I do not
become a Christian, I shall go to hell with my
eyes open. My faith is in Jesus Christ alone, and
beside him there is no Saviour.’ A Mohammedan
in the service of the Rajah has been the chief opposer,
and has tried to get others to say that Abdool
wished to compel people to become Christians.
A Molwee, who lives near, and to whom he first
addressed himself, told him at once he lied, and
was an infidel for opposing an idolater who wished
to believe in revelation, though not in Mohammed.
The Hindoos to whom he applied, said he was mad;
that they saw and heard all that passed in Abdool’s
house, and saw no violence offered to any one.
One Hindoo said, ‘I hear him forbid people to kill,
or to commit adultery, or to steal, or to tell lies;
if this be Christianity, it is a good religion; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
are no such good words even in the Sanscrit
books.’</p>

<p>“<em>July 11th.</em>—A man from a neighbouring village
was present to-day, who has been a constant
attendant for some time. He was asked why he
had expressed a wish to become a Christian? He
answered, ‘For the sake of salvation.’ What had
he heard, that should induce him to hope for salvation
in Christianity? He said, ‘He had never
heard of any whose birth corresponded with that
of Christ; that to raise the dead, and himself to
rise from the dead, proved him to be the Son of
God, and able to give remission of sins. He to-day
took his meal with the Christians, by which his
caste is gone.</p>

<p>“<em>July 24th.</em>—To-day a Mohammedan from Berthpore
came, who is physician to the Rajah’s family.
He had long ago perused the Pentateuch in Arabic,
lent him by a Roman Catholic priest, who lived
with General Duboin. About two years ago, it
came into his mind to search for truth. The
irreconcilable contradictions among the different
Mohammedan sects, struck him powerfully, and
convinced him that truth was not with them. He
read in the Koran, that Christ is the Spirit of God.
This gave him a high idea of our Saviour. He
took an opportunity of coming to Agra soon after
that time, when he visited Mr. C. the Baptist missionary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
who urged him to an immediate profession
of Christianity. This he was not prepared for, but
took a copy of St. Matthew and St. Mark, in Persian,
translated by Sabat, and went back to Berthpore.
There he has been until the present time,
fully persuaded of the truth of Christianity, and
the divinity of Christ, from the perusal of the above
translation, but desirous of meeting with some of
his own countrymen, who could inform him further;
he at length heard of Abdool, and of the kindness
and inoffensiveness of his manners. ‘This,’
said he, ‘is the way of that religion.’ And on
Monday, he came over on purpose to meet with
Abdool. He was led to the house of a Molwee,
who teaches our Christian boys Arabic, and who is
very favourable to the truth; so that his introduction
to Abdool was thus made easy. He now
wishes to be baptized; seems less than any native
whom I have seen, to consult with flesh and blood;
said he desired only to be great in the sight of God,
and, if it were his will, to be among the first fruits
of Hindoostan; for he is sure that all the land will
become Christian, and he desires to give himself
to labour to spread the Gospel. He has a son
eighteen years old, whom he has made acquainted
with the change passing in his mind; and who, he
says, is, equally with himself, disposed to embrace
the Gospel. He has gone back to bring this son,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
and what property he has, that he may give himself
wholly to the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>“<em>July 18th.</em>—This afternoon the above person
made his appearance, with his son, at worship in
the city. He had thought, he said, of sending his
son first: but afterward reflected, ‘This is not a
work to be delayed, or trifled with.’ He publicly
professed, before all the people assembled, that he
was come expressly to receive baptism. He laid
aside his turban, and knelt down to prayer with the
Christian part of the assembly.</p>

<p>“<em>July 23.</em>—To-day, Abdool’s eldest nephew, after
many solicitations, was examined for baptism.
So long since as the beginning of May, he had
been observed diligent in secret duties; and the
questions which he asked, discovered an awakened
conscience. On Monday last, he began to read
the Scriptures, and pray with the Catechumens.
This was after repeated requests to be allowed to
do so, and diligent application to private reading of
the Scriptures. To-day he was asked, ‘Why do
you wish to be baptized?’ He said, ‘Because I
am conscious of many and great sins, and I wish
to enter on the way of forgiveness.’</p>

<p>“<em>Ques.</em>—‘But perhaps the English government
may not always remain in this land; and you know,
in that case, the Hindoos and Mohammedans would
persecute you: what would you do?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Ans.</em>—‘Certainly, since they despised, and
persecuted, and ill-treated the Saviour, I can expect
no other; but, through his help, I would remain
firm.’</p>

<p>“<em>July 24th.</em>—During the whole of this week,
the Hugeem from Berthpore has attended daily with
his son. The Epistle to the Hebrews was appointed
to be read, to show him the connexion between
the Old and New Testaments. As we went on,
his attention was evidently attracted by the peculiar
truths of the Gospel—the divinity of Christ—his
suitableness, as God, to be a Saviour—the sufficiency
of his sacrifice, and the extent of it, as
reaching to sins under the former dispensation also.
The passages connected with these subjects, drew
from him many expressions indicative of a truly
enlightened mind. He has been daily also inquiring
about baptism; and as the subject has been on
his mind above two years, and he is now evidently
decided in his choice, it was agreed to baptize him
to-morrow. After talking of his family, I asked
if he was aware of any thing in his own history
for which God might be justly displeased with
him. He answered, ‘What have I done, that deserves
the name of virtue, all my days? If I have
done any thing good at all, it is this acceptance
of the truth.’”</p>

<p>Bishop Heber makes mention of Messeeh, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
his Journal, near Agra, January 12th, 1825, as
follows:—</p>

<p>“Abdool Messeeh breakfasted this morning at
Mr. Irving’s; he is a very fine old man, with a
magnificent grey beard, and much more gentlemanly
manners, than any Christian native whom I have
seen. His rank, indeed, previous to his conversion,
was rather elevated, since he was master of
the jewels to the court of Oude, an appointment of
higher estimation in eastern palaces, than in those
of Europe, and the holder of which has always a
high salary. Abdool Messeeh’s present appointments,
as Christian missionary, are sixty rupees a
month,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and of this, he gives away at least half.
Who can dare to say, that this man has changed
his faith from any interested motives? He is a very
good Hindoostanee, Persian, and Arabic scholar,
but knows no English. There is a small congregation
of native Christians, converted under Mr.
Corrie, when he was chaplain at Agra, and now
kept together by Abdool Messeeh. The earnest desire
of this good man is, to be ordained a clergyman
of the church of England; and if God spares his
life and mine, I hope, during the next autumn, to
confer orders on him. He is every way fit for
them, and is a most sincere Christian, quite free,
so far as I could observe, from all conceit or enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
His long eastern dress, his long grey beard,
and his calm, resigned countenance, give him already
almost the air of an apostle.”</p>

<p>In that year he was much afflicted by losing the
use of his limbs by the palsy; ‘but,’ said he, ‘I
can move about in a carriage, and God grants me
the faculty of speech. Through his blessing, I trust
I shall be permitted, until death, to declare the
truths of the gospel. When, at length, this sinful
body of mine is dead, and shall have put on immortality,
may I be found among the least of the
blessed!’</p>

<p>Thus he maintained a consistent Christian life,
and his closing hours were brightened with Christian
hope.</p>

<p>“He became ill; and Dr. Luxmore, finding him
in a dying condition, from mortification, had him
conveyed to his own house, where he was supplied
with suitable medicine, nourishment, and attendance,
to the last. He expressed his deep gratitude
for this change of residence; for he said, that had
he died at home among his own relations, they perhaps
would have interred his remains according to
the ceremonies of their own erroneous faith: ‘But
now,’ said he, ‘Christian brethren will bury me.’
He expressed himself as perfectly resigned; and
said that death had no terrors for him, for that his
Saviour had deprived it of its sting. He expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
to a friend who attended on him, his gratitude for
the kind attention of Mr. Ricketts, the Resident,
saying, ‘See the fruits of Christian love!’ The
day before his death, he requested his friend to
write his will. A house which the Resident had
enabled him to purchase, he left to his mother; his
books to the Bible Society, and his clothes to a
nephew. After concluding these formalities, he
said, ‘Thanks be to God, I have done with this
world! and with regard to my mother,’ putting his
hands in a supplicating posture, ‘I commend her
to God:’ then, laying his hand upon his nephew,
he said to his friend, ‘Speak to the Resident, that
no one be allowed to injure him:’ then desiring his
friend to come near him, and putting his hands in
an attitude of prayer, he said, ‘O Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, be gracious to——’</p>

<p>“On one occasion he inquired after a man who
had been with him for some time for religious instruction;
and being told he was at hand, desired
he might be called. On his approach, he questioned
him on some points of religion, and explained to
him the Lord’s Prayer throughout: he spoke of
his intention to baptize him, should he recover;
and desired, that, in the event of his death, a clerical
friend might be requested to do so. Shortly before
he expired, being told that the New Testament
was at hand, at his desire, the fourth chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of St. John was read to him; at the conclusion of
which, he said, ‘Thanks be to God!’ A hymn,
which he had composed a short time before, was
then sung, and of which the following is a paraphrase:—</p>

<p>“He joined in singing this hymn, and desired
that it might be sung a second time: but he could
no longer articulate distinctly, and soon became insensible
to every thing around him. He lay,
seemingly in perfect ease, till the evening; when
he raised his head from the pillow, and with his
left hand took hold of the hand of his friend—then
gently withdrew it—and breathed his last.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
